Sorry to say but you're only on the top of the iceberg when it comes to ethical products. I recommend looking into fast fashion next since it seems like you care about this type of stuff.
"If we ban Temu on the grounds of slave labor, there's a bit more left to do....


WEW this thread is full of slave labor apologia"
One thing I will say about Temu is that it exposes how much of what is on Amazon is literally just re-packaged stuff from places like Temu. 
"Temu, Amazon, Apple, Nike........list is endless. They all need strict regulation."
"Hopefully Nestle is on your boycott list too, considering they do slave labor and have killed a holocaust amount of babies 😅"
Ethnical labor? Look up how chocolate is made 😳
"SHEIN is exactly the same in this regard. It’s absolutely astonishing, once you realize the conditions these workers work in, the amount of  hours they work, and the pay they make. It’s so sad, because SHEIN is huge in fast fashion, and there’s a reason for that. Essentially slave labor is the only way these companies can do what they do, at the capacity they do it."
How are Temu's labor practices worse than Nike?
If temu was banned another will take it's place
"I didn’t pay that much attention to Temu’s business practices because it’s just an extremely unfortunate reality of today (although I have never and will never download it), until tiktok got banned for chinese spyware. Okay, now do it for Temu. If they don’t, that really just goes to show they didn’t have the safety of the american public in mind. There’s something else going on."
"There’s so much “what-about-ism” and elitism in these comments lmao 

Tones of people don’t even disagree, but are just saying “Yer dumb becoz you didn’t consider these other issues/companies that do the same”

Edit: the what-aboutism I’m bringing up isn’t that other apps do the same and that we should treat them  the same. I agree with that point. I’m referring directly to the people who are hand waving away this as an issue at all because “there are worse things” or “all companies do this”"
Reminds me of Amazon.
"Anyone who works in the USA is owned by the US government.

Your entire existence is to pay taxes."
Guess you don't want to shop like a billionaire 🙃
"As a mailman, dear God, please.  Make it stop"
"Muricans: bann them, they do to us what we did to the rest of the world. LOL"
"So many companies are doing this, it's insane. I just did a research paper on fast fashion and you would be surprised at the little amount of clothing companies that are actually NOT using slave labor or destroying the environment. 

Just a fun tidbit for everyone I found in my research: even recycling your clothing is directly harming people and the environment. Oftentimes our ""recycled"" clothing is sent to countries like Africa, where it gets piled up and then lights on fire and causes deaths. They call it ""dead white-mans clothing"". When you donate to Goodwill, etc... the clothing is either sent to be a pile in another country or put into heaps of trash."
"I'm going to give you the US perspective, you realize probably 90% of the products you own are ""Made in China"" and there is a reason the US imports those items vs making them here?  It was decided a long time ago (before there was a Gen Z) that it was more profitable to not to pay US citizens to make products we use because our wages were too high when China would make them for us and we could import them for much less.  Now, lets look at the current concept that younger people want to be paid $25+ plus to work zero skill jobs.... our system is so broken and we can't even afford to make products in this country that this country uses.  Now, don't get me wrong, I understand the majority of the US population is underpaid based on the current situation (housing, renting, inflation, car prices, insurance, the cost of food, and the list goes on forever).  Business owners want to make the most profit possible and not share the wealth (because they took the risk), so the simple question is do you pay someone $20 an hour to make pencils or is it cheaper to pay another country that is paying $1 an hour to make your pencils and import them?  Until politicians want to address this issue, it will continue to happen.  Politicians don't want to address this issue because business owners and deals are where they make their money.  You have the corrupt, hindering the citizens to make money, which they then fund the law makers to sway laws in their favor, ultimately taking away job opportunities for US citizens because China will do it cheaper, and the business owners make more money from profits over time.  Those lawmakers you hope ban it, are profiting on it and it doesn't matter which side you are on in the political spectrum."
"You might want to sit down for this one mate… every single company on planet Earth relies on exploitation of workers. Workers put in and do not receive the full value of their labour, it is extracted as profit by our rival class - the bourgeoisie. This is an inherent to a capitalist mode of production.

It is good that you’ve recognised some exploitation, it is nice that you’ve wanted to do something. It’s also very important to recognise that this doesn’t stop at a Chinese company or at slavery. You will be exploited (if you aren’t being already), your mum and your uncle are probably being exploited, the lawmakers you talk about are reaping the benefits of exploitation.

Sorry to get all “Let the ruling classes tremble! The workers have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win”. But you have your foot in the door here, you can now push it open and see the extent of this exploitation."
This is the craziest thread I've read in a while...
"Yeah and what about H&M, Ikea, Zara, Nestle, DFA, Walmart, fucking Facebook using my data for who knows what? Should I leave in a forest now or what?"
You know America outsourced all their manufacturing to China to save on labour and increase profit at the expense of domestic jobs. Basically everything comes from China now. Corporations don't care how the profits increase like how the pharaoh doesn't care how the pyramids are made. It's all the same polyester/plastic just a different factory and the customer doesn't pay the 1000% markup for licensing or whatever. Some of that stuff you order on amazon probably gets directly shipped from China. Reps beat resale every time for price and value.
Do you realize how many companies either exploit their workers (even US based) or use slave and child labor?
There is no ethical consumption under capitalism
Whenever I see something in a temu ad that I like I screenshot it and use the google image search to find the real version so I can buy it there if I want. I only ever get their ads on the occasional times I use Instagram
"My mom buys cheap useless crap no one needs off temu, she's had her credit card info stolen twice that I know of because of it. That and the intentionally undercut prices to out compete their competitors are huge red flags. They want to become an established seller then they'll up their prices like Amazon did when they first started, that's why they're OK with the idea of selling at a loss of profit for now."
"it sucks, but people need to remember, the reason most use it is they can't afford anything else. I use shein because it's cheap and I'm a teen with barely any cash. it sucks, but most of us are broke and can't afford target stuff. "
Look into the animal agriculture industry next
"
I think it’s really cool you found out abt neoglobalism n stuff
So like pretty much it is all very terrible 
many products, have been outsourced the last 40 years to other nations for the extremely cheap labor which includes horrible work conditions 
look into the rust belt 
More Recently many tech jobs have been outsourced to other nations,
& so many factories can’t operate at that extreme output other nations do because of modern day US EPA Regulations & OSHA health standards to do so would require paying workers American dollars & in Mexico 1 dollar is 20 pesos and less regulations so corporations can build a factory in other nations like Mexico or outsource to a nation with a cheap and unsafe labor practices because they can and always will 
It’s really just the corporations defunding an already gutted government & a government unwilling to clean itself up on both sides sorry for ranting 

Sorry for ranting corporations suck

">Not only is it a data-harvesting scam

So is meta, Twitter, tik Tok, YouTube, etc. they all harvest and sell your data. Literally nothing new.

>they've all but admitted to using slave labor, and have somehow been able to get away with exporting millions of products made in concentration camps thus far.

Yea welcome to China bud, most everything made in China comes from a sweatshop. Your clothing and shoes Chinese child slave labor.

>lawmakers are able to get it banned soon

Or they could focus on fixing our fucking up political system and stay tf outta other countries. We got better things to worry about other then a fucking app."
Temu is what I call wish off of wish
"I mean if we're gunna start banning shit like Tik Tok, why not Nike, Apple, and all those other corps using slave labor"
"Temu, Shein etc are hyperfast fashion. It's meant to be thrown into a landfill when you get bored of the plastic clothes you've bought."
Baby's first exposure to the realities of capitalism.
Let's ban Amazon and Shen too cause most of their products are made in exploitation of slave labor
With that same logic most US companies should also get the axe (and I agree)
"Well, let's ban all the companies that do that—so 90% of US companies that use out-of-country labor."
"I hate to burst your bubble, but virtually all US made goods are made from slave... Err free prison labor. Slavery was never banned in the US, it was just rebranded."
Gen Z waking up
"Same with tik tok,  ban both"
"I like how half the comments act like banning it wouldn't be good because it doesn't fix everything all at once. Progress is progress, don't need silver bullets if it's going to do harm to this human-hostile business model."
"I see a lot of people mentioning Nike as employing the same labor but the difference is that Nike has about 40 different Chinese partners while temu has about 5,000. They aren’t comparable"
"Apple uses slave labor. Target uses slave labor. Hell, even most US produce comes from extremely unfair exploitation of migrant workers which I would argue is slave labor. The phone I'm typing with right now undoubtedly used slave labor somewhere down the line. Slave labor is ingrained in our consumer culture. It reminds me of The Good Place, when a character buys a tomato and loses hundreds of 'good people points' because it was produced with slave labor and pesticides. I don't know what the solutions are but Temu isn't even the tip of the iceberg. It's just more transparent about it's exploitative practices than other companies that pretend to have values. "
Isn't this how capitalism works? Isn't capitalism the bedrock of American society?
But are the queer kids using it to find each other? No? That's what I thought.
But if they ban Temu where am I going to get my shoes that can play Ballin?
"Lol please tell me what phone you have, what pc you have, car and where do you buy your clothes? I swear this is a very hypocrite post"
"Temu is the best, I love giving Uncle XI my personal credit card info. He can buy all sorts of goodies for himself with my money. Which he wouldn't be able to afford otherwise. Those Chinese oligarchs are poor and need donations in order to survive.


*Satire, in case it's not obvious."
All of these clothing companies uses slave labor even your favorite clothing brands
Do you think USA has a grip on China's market?
I don't know a single person who has ever used that website
Comes preinstalled on most phones nowadays.
"Isn’t it just like Amazon?

Amazon is guilty of all that stuff except for one detail. It’s based in America and so is subservient to Americas military industrial and foreign control agenda. 

Temu is just repeating what works. Their only sin is they do not answer to America’s hegemony."
"If you don't have an issue with their slave labour due to stupid whataboutisms (wEsTeRN cOmpaNiES tOO!!!1!11), then at least consider the environment and the fact you're getting ripped-off. Temu is the lowest-quality bullshit out there - absolute rock-bottom. It's a gaping hole in your internet security and on top of it - look-up how China cares about the environment. They'd rather paint the hills green (LITERALLY) than fix their pollution. I personally refuse to buy anything from China - not just Temu."
Probably should look into Nestle too...
you'd be surprised as to how little billionaires shop 
There is no such thing as ethical consumerism.
"Ive been a delivery driver for years. As I get pretty up close and personal with the consumption habits of humans it is now really starting to take a toll on my brain.  I used to enjoy the freedoms and travels- seeing places most people will never see as my branded truck is permitted and random vehicles are not.
The Temu explosion has brought me to my final days. ""Why do you care what people buy?!? Just do your job!"" is a constant response if I bring up my opinions and feelings on this new way of ordering literal garbage. I really dont know why it bothers me so much. The number of households who are basically totally addicted to Temu is shocking to me. Multiple large bags daily for quite a few of the same addresses. Others will order a few times per week. My workload has increased 2x simply due to Temu.
Idc how cheap it is. Its cheap because of terrible reasons yet most people dont WANT to know those reasons. And it shld be lasso'd and reigned-in tightly if not outrught banned."
Documentaries on the horribleness of fast fashion should be required viewing. We’re destroying Ghana and other countries we dump discarded useless fabric.
Ban Temu in the United States.
OP probably complains that he is paying way too much for fast food.
"That means we'd have to ban the great wall mart too.

There's a documentary called the high cost of low price that talks exclusively about Walmart."
"Everyone wants to ban slave labor until they realize what products they use that are made from slave labor (cell phones, electric cars, anything computerized due to the cobalt and lithium mines that our rival countries have a significant market share of due to their geographical location)"
"yeah, no lol"
"China is into everything, they can push whatever narrative they please through social media, not just Tik Tok. China produces fentanyl to sell the the drug cartels and directly to street dealers in the US, that itself directly causes gang warfare between US gangs and cartels. 

However, you can blame corrupt officials from the west for our manufacturing, production and distribution being handed to China. The UK has been on its inevitable decline since we outsourced manufacturing and production to Chinese sweatshops. Tories are sitting up top selling OUR assets to foreign companies and each other.

The Chinese aren’t entirely to blame, it’s the neoliberal agenda of the people at the top looking to get richer."
"We really need to decouple our economy from China in every way. 

They are the most dangerous country in the world rn."
Did you post this on your handheld device containing conflict minerals by any chance?
"So it's ok for all of the US to outsource jobs to places with bad conditions in the name of saving money?  But if the average Joe wants to get something cheaper then it should be banned?

Confusing logic, if you ask me?
Cognitive dissonance is fucking wild."
"""I've recently been down a rabbit hole on China's grip on the US market"" is a very funny phrase.

Log off right wing youtube and touch grass."
"The concentration camps thing doesn't really fly since you also have them in the USA from ICE.

But I fully agree with the other stuff... All Chinese import websites btw"
Temu always seemed like a massive scam to me.
All these arguments could easily be framed on US companies too. Just saying “they’re from China” just makes you sound more “Chinese exclusion act” racist and Sinophobic than actually morally righteous
I stay away from Chinese made products as much as possible.
"Ban everything Chinese made honestly. China is a wonderful country with great people living there - however - the CCP is on a warpath and stands for ideals that are the exact opposite of the United States’ ideals. The sooner the public of the US realizes that China is our largest adversary the better. 

This is also why banning tiktok, an app used to push divisive messaging, is a good thing."
"""i support the CCP in general"".. Why?"
"This is also the reason I don't buy from alibaba or Temu. Although I work for a company that works with chinese factories. These factories are inspected every 6 months to see the labor conditions of the workers. However, we know that we don't know everything. They might as well pretend for a day. Almost all our products that we buy in other countries come from china. It's though because you just don't know what it is really like. As an european we have rules about importing products but those Chinese factories can probably find loopholes through it.

But yeah, I also try to be very cautious to not buy from these websites"
"Temu, shein, alibaba, h&m, etc"
"While I understand the sentiment of banning Chinese threats like Temu or Tiktok, isn't it essentially conceding defeat? Like ""China is doing social media and online shopping better than America is, so just ban them""? China was always criticized for Internet censorship, and the Western banning of Chinese sites is just the admission that they were right all along."
Temu and tiktok should both be banned.
Wait until OP finds out about chocolate and coffee.
"Thank you, OP.

"""Not only is it a data-harvesting scam ...""

So, Temu is like Google?"
"Your pretending like, apple, Walmart, almost ALL designer clothing etc hasn't used child labor for literal decades.  It's always been a thing since the great tech boom of the 80s and the .com boom of the 90s"
This post was brought to you by Amazon.
"I have some bad news about your shoes. And phone. And... well, everything."
"Oh sweet summer child, you think stuff from Amazon is different with Teemu? What if i told you a lot of Amazon sellers are also from China and South East Asia? 
Same shit, different distribution."
"Oh, Straight up.

Temu is China's way of flooding the global market with cheap goods so that when they inevitably collapse, the world will collapse too."
The United States has innovative tech companies like Amazon that use advanced analytics and flexible supply chains to build popular new business models. China has scary tech companies like temu that serve as data harvesting scams and use slave labor to get people addicted to giving them money.
Let’s get rid of Wish and Aliexpress too while we’re at it.
"the concerns about temu and china's influence are valid. data privacy and unethical labor practices are serious issues to be wary of. it's good you're looking out for your family and trying to make informed choices. i hope lawmakers address these problems thoroughly.

i've read about the controversies surrounding temu and china's buisness practices. data harvesting and potential slave labor are major red flags. kudos to you for being proactive in protecting your family. hopefully lawmakers can get to the bottom of this situation soon.  

the temu app and its links to china raise some troubling questions. data privacy violations and forced labor are major ethical breaches. great that you're looking out for your loved ones - i hope legislators can put an end to these shady practices.

while i can't speak to the specifics, the concerns about temu and china's influence are well-founded. data harvesting and unethical labor are serious issues. glad you're being proactive in safeguarding your family - hopefully lawmakers step up to address this properly."
"I don't know what temu is but if you're claiming they are using slave labour then i suggest studying more about the products you are currently using... Yes i mean everything from the threads in your shirts, the screws on your phone and everything else that's not locally made.


If this ""Temu"" gets banned then it'll be a good opening to also ban all major brands. Which could be good or bad depending on how much influence they have on the economy"
"If you ban temu in America for slave labor, you also need to ban capitalism in America."
"Alongside Hugo Boss, Channel, Mitsubishi to name a few."
Temu just sells junk
"Honestly I don't think most people end up being return customers. Like myself, I think most people try it out once to see if it lives up to it's promise, realize they are selling manufactured waste, and then never buy from them again."
Toss out your iPhone
Show me where they say they use slave labor my guy
i dont have money. If i see some kitchen appliance while shopping and they ask 25e for it you can bet your butthole im ordering that shit for 90c and dont give a fuck.
"According to this sub, Chinese kids are working with electronics and nano fabrication as ""slave labor"" while reddit kids can barely get out of their house lol."
Just blow up all big companies and k*ll all millionaires and billionaires
"So basically regular online stores but cheaper, and less middle men"
"As a former mailman I fully support this opinion, the amount of bullshit people order online is insane."
"My parents have always said “if it’s too good to be true, then it probably is”. Temu has never hidden what it is. It has always sold items at “too good to be true” prices. That’s the whole schtick. 

I never downloaded it (thinking it has to run on slave labor in order to make some kind of profit.) Even so the profit would be marginal at best. Governmental espionage fills in that gap. Honestly it’s obvious when you follow the money.

Thank you for reenforcing the wisdom of my parents. Boomers definitely get it right sometimes."
"Oh boy, many grey discoveries await you my friend"
Isn't Temu that app boomers use to buy cheap crap? It'll never get banned if so because boomers still control our government.
"We should, in general, get used to not buying anything from china"
If you are typing this from a iPhone this post is nothing short of ironic.
"""buhhh Nike bad too""

Whats easier? Not downloading one app? Or undoing every bad thing the country has ever done? You people are fucking exhausting!"
"Fun fact, essentially all the shit you buy in 'normal' stores for a 'normal' price is also made in the exact same conditions, the seller just takes a larger margin."
"Well all the toys are laced with arsenic apparently , would never touch it"
It's exactly the same as any US trash that sells products made in China or Bangladesh. But because it's a foreign company it's bad
"hell, just look at like 90% of amazon's inventory. exact same products, exact same working conditions, just sold at higher margins with fast shipping."
Right? This has been an ongoing argument for 50 years.
I just buy second-hand and I'm content.
"Yeah this is the same as  [/r/fucknestle](https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckNestle/s/65ZpMCYrbL). It's true that these corporations are bad, but if you ban them, a new one will pop up. Ultimately capitalism requires the exploitation of people and the environment. No ethical consumption under capitalism.

This is not meant to dissuade people from criticizing these companies, but if you really want to get rid of the problem you have to start at the root."
"Temu, Shien and such are all branches of the same thing."
And Nestle.
Like the prison industrial complex?
">If we ban Temu on the grounds of slave labor, there's a bit more left to do

Yes, and we should do it. If we can't have certain things without slavery, then we shouldn't have those certain things

Edit: to those trying to ""gotcha"" me because I use a smart phone, have food, clothes, etc. These things are almost necessities in life today(almost meaning smartphone isnt a ""necessity"" but having access to the internet will be completely necessary in the future i assure you), and are you honestly telling me there is no possible way these multibillion dollar corporations can't pay people? If you think that slave labor is the only way to get these things, you clearly don't realize how much money these companies have. There is enough to pay people a wage, they choose not to"
"Real 

Asian Slaver Labor: 😢

American Slave labor: 🥰"
"The EU has very recently passed a supply chain law prohibiting any product made with the use of forced labor from being sold within the EU. 

This likely won‘t catch everything right away (cocoa would almost certainly have to be banned entirely which isn‘t happening), but it does set the right priorities as a step one. Laws like this are also the only way to tackle this problem."
"Slave labor is okay as long as white American oligarchs are benefiting instead of Chinese oligarchs /s 

Is that the apologia you’re seeing?"
"Far too many people are ""China bad"" not ""Thing China does is bad, ban the thing""."
"Just a heads up the stuff being sold on Temu is the same stuff sold in dollar stores, Walmarts and Amazon just for a few bucks more.

Shit doesn't stop at Temu."
"This is the problem with all discourse like this lately. 

“Thing bad. We should stop”

“If you think that’s bad, here’s a lot of other bad stuff. Are you proposing to stop all this, too?”

Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good, dammit."
lol Yeah - Temu bad because it uses slave labor **and** is also a Chinese company. Capitalism using slave labor is fine as long as it profits American companies.
Gotta get the ball rolling somewhere
"Yeah, like what grip does China really have on the US market? It's pretty much a symbiotic relationship while some American oligarchs cry sour grapes that they don't have a complete monopoly. Look at how US tech companies in bed with the US government and pentagon dominate the social media of so many other countries and have been directly linked to fostering rightwing extremism and even civil unrest that leads to societal collapse when the US government gets involved.

Temu encourages you to impulsively consume? What and US tech companies don't? And all of a sudden now slave labor is a problem? Sweetie, the US economy runs on slave labor domestically and through its exploitation abroad in neocolonies. Who do you think is making your coffees, chocolates, electronic devices, etc.

American oligarchs and their regulatory capture in the US government just want to ban Chinese companies because of competition, not because of some moral clarity. Tech companies extract your private information and sell it to advertisers. American oligarchs feel entitled to your private data, as well as everybody else's in the world, as if it were their petty fiefdom. A Chinese company acts as competition in their capitalist market therefore they have less private information to sell to marketers if there is competition to selling that private information. Banning a Chinese company won't solve your private information being sold, won't solve the use of slave labor in creating products sold in the US, won't solve exploitative practices to encourage impulse buying. An American company is going to and does all those same things. In fact, I'd prefer a Chinese company have my private information than an American company because at least I know the Chinese company isnt in bed and giving my private information to local police departments, fbi, or the US state like we've seen countless times, such as American tech companies informing local police departments about women seeking abortions."
"Walmart...Hobby Lobby...Michaels, dollar type stores...even Target, BB&B... Amazon....Etsy infiltrated with drop shippers duping and shipping out of China.

All massively profiting from slave labor and environmental pollution"
"The overall sentiment in these conversations is that it's bad when China does it but it's ok when the ""West"" does it. 

People don't care about the principle, they just hate whatever boogeyman they've been told to hate."
"Capitalism as a whole has gone past the point of salvation.  
  
  For instance, I buy guitars a lot, and sites like AliExpress sell replicas for a lot of major brands. I assumed that they were a lot of independent builders who just wanted to cash in on a popular model and brand, but that's barely ever the case.  
  
  What is really happening is that major guitar companies outsource most of their labor to China, Indonesia, Korea and so on.. so most of the knock off guitars are actually just extra guitars from the same factories.  
  
  So the (potentially) sweat shop conditions of the third party AliExpress sellers are often the exact same shop as the ones making the more expensive versions, and the only difference in the guitars is that you are paying an American corporation as a middle man and making sure the people in Asia, who actually did the work, are getting a smaller cut of the profits.  
  
  In some instances, buying from AliExpress or TEMU is actually better, because no matter what, the global marketplace is being reaped by someone who did basically nothing and is collecting more money for it than those who are working the labor."
We get rid of slave labour the whole Western economy would collapse overnight
"Yeah it’s amazing that “basically slave labor” actually means it didn’t use slave labor. Just extremely cheap Chinese labor. 

But then on the flip side all electric vehicles are build using some slave labor because of the cobalt."
"First and foremost, we need to close the loophole that lets Temu import so much without paying any tariffs.


Then we can start with the more complicated work. Because Temu isn't the source of the forced labor problem, it's just one of it's major players in the West right now."
"Sure, it would be a good start, though!"
"Came here to say this, glad I was beaten to it"
Gotta start somewhere…
"Yeah, uhm, everything on temu is also on Amazon, faire, wish, and alibaba."
"Ok sounds great, ban slave labour everywhere"
The same people who want us to uninstall Temu because of “slave labour” will call Beyonce “Queen B” even though she does exactly the same.
"I am seeing a bit of back and forth arguing about Temu being the line that we draw in the sand, how we have to start somewhere, etc.

I know some aren't aware, but Temu is selling *exactly the same* goods, from the same labor, as on Amazon. It *is* somewhat hypocritical to go on a tear against Temu *if* you don't have the same opinions regarding Amazon."
Yea our lives are built on blood and exploitation past and present lol
A good start would be the apparel industry then agriculture
"People: “ we need to pay workers living wage!”

Also people: “umma shop on Temu.”"
Not going to disagree but a first step and some pamphlets to educate your peers and those close to you is a good beginning towards positive change
"There’s no way an American company would ever harvest user data or use slave labour, right?"
First they came for the slave labor sweatshop factory owners...
It's CCP bots
"If Temu goes, can we please boot fucking Nestle from every country on the damn planet"
"“slave labour apologia” was not something i expected to read today, thanks for the brain rot warning"
"Honestly, Etsy is the worst for this. I've literally seen the same jewellery on temu being sold on Etsy for hundreds of dollars. There's definitely lots, if not mostly, real handmade artisanal products, but people flipping cheap crap as their own handmade items is definitely an issue on there."
A lot of small “bins” stores full of Temu crap are popping up every where now. We have three in my town and all three are full of Temu/Aliexpress items.
"They’re regulated by people who have no desire to see any change. Our social and political structures are informed by a capitalist mode of production, they do not seek to undermine the system that has birthed them."
"Or the whole ""Water isn't a human right"" thing."
Btw. Danone did the exact same thing (the thing with giving out baby formula)
r/fucknestle
"Please educate me on the wrongdoings of nestle, I have never heard any of that"
And they want water to go the way of privatization.
The reality is that it’s hard to boycott these big brands and live a normal life in today’s world. Many people shop at Temu because of the cheap prices. Inflation has made things really expensive all across the board and people don’t have as much spending power as before. Nestle is hard to boycott too
"Chocolate ranks as one of the absolute worst food items to produce in terms of environmental impact in addition to the treatment of farmers that raise the plants. Which btw is so bad a British reporter from the BBC interviewed a farmer, invited him to eat a piece of chocolate, and said “This is your chocolate” because the farmers economically aren’t able to buy their own product.

Fun fact: Even though the cacao bean used to be native to the South American continent, 80 to  90% (somewhere in that ballpark) of the world’s ENTIRE cacao bean supply comes from Ghana and a couple surrounding areas in Africa."
"It's all screwed up. The whole system. The only reason they have slave labor is because people are desperate enough for the money. We get rid of it, where do these people go? Chances are they didn't decide to work at a sweatshop, it was just the only work they could find.

How do we get rid of the industry while also helping the workers find new jobs? Where would the jobs come from?

The fact that the world in general is capitalistic means that the laws are going to be in support of that, above all else.

In short: we're screwed. We been screwed."
"Not necessarily defending Nike, but more to help you understand the differences because they are significant. 

Nike faced a lot of criticism in the 90's but has taken great measures to improve their supply chain, including auditing their supply network for violations of US Labor laws. They have also been allowing third party reviews of their supply chain since the early 2000s and have made many efforts to increase public transparency. 
https://www.businessinsider.com/how-nike-solved-its-sweatshop-problem-2013-5

Temu does not do this. They have basic agreements with their suppliers that do not enforce work conditions, and may rely on slave labor from incarcerated Chinese (we don't know because they won't allow audits).
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/22/business/economy/shein-temu-forced-labor-china.html

Edit: third party"
"Avoiding both isn’t mutually exclusive. Nike is vile but Temu is a mass service with exponentially rising growth, so that’s why they’re mentioning it specifically. Doesn’t mean you shouldn’t also avoid Nike…and the majority of large brands for that matter."
[removed]
And probably kinder than Nestle
"When someone says “temu is bad” and the response is “what about nike” is that supposed to get people to say “yeah nike is bad” and start boycotting both or are they saying “don’t care about temu until nike is fixed” because the latter is how it seems and it’s like we can’t complain about anything until there is nothing to complain about. So… we can complain, but only when there is nothing to complain about? Until then we can only complain about what is the worst and if someone says there is something worse we’re supposed to shut up and say “you’re right, so smart to know about other bad things”.

Nope, stop trying to control what other people care about!"
[deleted]
All the other social media companies lobby the government. Wouldn't be the first time that a competitor was iced out this way.
"No clue why this was downvoted, research had repeatedly shown that Temu is far worse than TikTok when it comes to malware, spyware, and data harvesting."
"Yeah, it's called sinophobia and politics."
"The same company's that own those two apps have a half dozen at the top of the android app store too, It so confusing to see them go after tiktok and pat themselves on the back when it was actually only the first step of many if they are trying to ""protect data"" or whatever they are claiming its for."
"It’s not that difficult, It’s not just spyware, it’s influence. TikTok has the capability to influence people’s view of the world. They can tweak their algorithm to show you whatever suits them or hide stuff that doesn’t suit them. Couple that with data mining your interest, that’s an insanely powerful way to influence you.
Look up what happened with Cambridge Analytica.


Temu has nowhere near that power, even if it’s a data harvest. It’s not just spyware, it’s what they can do with it."
"In my opinion it's pretty clear to people paying attention that the official reasoning for the TikTok ban was McCarthyist, red scare nonsense designed to get people to turn their brains off and be afraid of the designated Enemy Country. All so they wouldn't realize how authoritarian it is for our government to give itself the power to shut down any media platform it deems a ""national security threat."" It's the same way they passed the PATRIOT Act after 9/11 which gave the feds basically unlimited ability to spy on anyone in any way for any reason, and if you opposed it, you ""supported terrorism"" or whatever."
I don't think calling it whataboutism is a solid defense when the only companies that ever seen to get called out for regulatory action on these issues are non-Western. Similar to how Tiktok's data harvesting is apparently the worst thing in history but Google tracking every aspect of your life gets far less scrutiny. It's completely fair to question the motives of those who focus only on certain countries for these issues
"Agreed. Although I agree that Nike, Amazon, Nestlé, Apple, WalMart, and pretty much every other large corporation is using bad labor practices, it is not realistic or even possible for people to stop buying every product made unethically. Unethical production is so ingrained into products sold in the US, trying to eliminate even 75% of unethical brands from your life at once would be too overwhelming. I don't think the sentiment ""well if you're going to shop at Amazon, who cares about Temu"" is helpful.

I think that an overall reduction in consuming, especially unnecessary or superfluous purchasing, is a reasonable first step for your average person. Cutting out Temu, Shein, Wish, etc is a good start as those apps are specifically designed to encentivize impulse purchasing on a large scale."
"It’s not whataboutism to bring up related issues. We should strive to enforce morality and laws universally and equally. It is not logical to ban a Chinese company for bad labor practices while supporting American companies that utilize those exact same labor practices, and do it on a larger scale. To me it makes more sense to push for more universal regulation of such things, and then ban any of the companies if they don’t comply. To single out Chinese companies is in my opinion short sighted at best and xenophobic at worst. 

Now there’s a separate argument regarding data security, but that isn’t the argument OP is making, and not one I am not invested in for much of the same reasons."
"Fun fact: the term Whataboutism was first popularized (not first used, but popularized) when people would criticize lynchings and then be accused of using those issues to distract from the 'atrocities' of the Soviets. 

It's always been projection."
I think the word you’re looking for is “deflection”
"If you want people to stop using Temu, then where else do you expect people to go in replace of it?

Chances are you'll end up with another corporation doing the same thing. So you're stuck with the same problem, hence whataboutism is irrelevant here."
It's not whataboutism to call out your double standards.
"""Hey I've heard this one before"""

Most of the products you find on temu are resold on amazon prime but with a reseller and Jeff Bezos taking a cut.
"Your entire existence is to be exploited so others can make a profit, the taxes are just an extra that go to keeping the status quo place."
The government is owned by capitalists and operates for capitalists.
I can only afford to shop like a thousandaire right now
Exactly
It’s called hypocrisy
"Also heads up, the exportation of manufacturing jobs is about to start happening on a massive scale to the software engineering sector. Computer programmers are much cheaper in India and SEA. This problem will continue to get worse.

(To a certain extent it's already happening)"
"I've just got one correction here - don't throw the business owners under the bus, the vast majority of small and medium sized business are doing more than their fair share in sharing the wealth. Yeah, the owner of the company usually has the most money - but not so disproportionate as you'd think. It's not uncommon when there are bad economic times for a small business owner to not pay themself to pay their employees.

When you are a business owner, and you're staring at your employees and times are tough, all you can really think about is that employees whole livelihood is dependent on your ability to bring in more business and pay them. That weighs on you big time and you end up working way beyond normal hours to make damn sure that pay check doesn't bounce.

Additionally, for most small business owners, the majority of the money they spend for services and other things to keep the business running they spend locally as much as possible business owners look after business owners that way - keeping the $$$ in the local economy. Corporations drain capital from one market and send it to another. 

Are there scuzzy small business owners? Absolutely. Not saying there aren't greedy ones. But by far the average small business owner is doing everything they possibly can to make sure the team they have working for them can be successful and have a livelihood."
"Let's fix something... ""current concept that younger people want to be paid $25+ plus to work zero skill jobs""

That $25/hr is what many people NEED to afford basic housing and health insurance these days.  Don't point your finger at the low earners when the cost of basic living has outpaced wage increases 3:1 over the past 20 years."
Basically most but if one was to be taken down and laws were to be put in place we’d at least be getting somewhere but nah world is too greedy
Do they have thrift stores in your area that you can utilize? (genuine question)
"Target stuff is still fast fashion that involves slave labor. There isn’t much we can do on an individual level, but your best bet is thrift stores if you want to try. But part of Temus success is also people buying in excess. You may be broke and that’s why you use Temu, but that doesn’t mean you need to constantly be buying new stuff either. No one NEEDS an entire wardrobe of clothes. But it’s pushed heavily especially on young people to get the new trendy items asap."
"imho, it's a pretty dumb excuse because you don't \*need\* any of that stuff."
You can literally go to a thrift store
🙄
The sad reality is that this will go unaddressed.
"I live in the rustbelt. Lots of poverty and homeless, but we're too busy (as a country) looking outside our borders and are basically ignoring the fire consuming the house (country). It's appalling to me, there's so many people suffering within our borders and they're getting a ""Fuck you, no one cares it's all your fault""."
"Fix the ""broken"" economies within the USA too. Places like rural Appalachia and former factory towns are basically second world in some places. It's a disgrace."
Yea why won’t the US just leave China alone? What with all the US apps collecting data on Chinese citizens.
The government could care less about our privacy or whether the products we consume are ethically made. There’s no reason for them to ban temu as long as it’s not harming the economy significantly.
"why aren't twitter, reddit, instagram, discord and snapchat being banned then?"
"I know you are not talking about TikTok. Lmfaoooo! Tik-Tok is the same as YouTube, Vine, Facebook, instagram, and so on. If you are implying the TikTok ban is part of an agenda to separate “queer kids” you are deluded. If that is the case, just as delusional as a politician who thinks that would work."
Yeah yeah yeah but have you thought about how those aren’t CHINESE companies?!?!
"Spelling out the whole word is the best choice, I did /S once and people still didn’t think it was satire or sarcasm"
I try to not buy anything on China but it’s basically impossible. I was looking for a scale and every single one in the store was made in China. Most likely they are all made in the same factory by the same workers just for different companies.
Except in this case Advanced Analytics = Worker Exploitation
"Sounds like this is written by a child trying to sound like they know things, or bad ai"

Yeah temu made me realize how much of Amazon's stock is just dropshipping from China.
Exactly. And Amazon doesn't treat their employees well and also takes extremely anticompetitive measures against small businesses.
If you reverse image search a lot of their shit is from shein for a higher price on Amazon
"Just like how Mark Zuckerberg was inline with getting TikTok banned in the U.S., would be interesting to see if Jeff Bezos would want Temu banned from expanding in the U.S. with their plans of putting their own warehouses and having their own delivery system in the U.S."
"This is sort of what is driving me crazy about this conversation. Temu and Amazon have essentially the same inventory and Amazon is not doing anything *better* with your data. 

I'm not arguing Temu is good -- they're both bad -- but you are still identically supporting Chinese slave labor if you shift your purchasing from Temu to Amazon. It's not a meaningful shift. To really make an impact we have to stop buying so much crap."
First company comes to mind is nestle then Ford's rubber farm
"This is literally what I prefer to do for my toddler. Clothes and toys made from natural materials, used from eBay or locally through social media or community centers. It's so easy to search for good, expensive brands. Kids use things for a few years, max. If the item is good quality and ethically made, it'll be absolutely fine. Maybe a few scuffs or marks. But you KNOW it's good because it survived. I find so many things that are basically new.

My mother in law spends more money on individual items as gifts and they're all plastic crap, or clothes that are thin and badly sewn. They fall apart within a few months. It's horrible. I keep begging her to stick to used from charity shops, and she keeps getting me this crap. It's so frustrating."
"I see a lot of people making the argument that the root of the problem is capitalism. The truth is capitalism is only half the problem. The main issue is that our money supply is corrupt. Our money is owned and created by private interest, and this creation of new currency causes inflation, which forces business to be unethical in their attempt to stay competitive. Essentially, with a corrupt money, capitalism can never be pure free-trade and will be corrupt as well."
Or maybe they meant the slave labour we use to get 90% of all the cobalt we put into our phones are cars
"It's way worse than people understand. The practice of slavery didn't end. It just shifted to exclusively prisons. The justification for this is basically ""You should pay off your debt to society."" We're the only first world nation that uses the actual word ""slavery"" in its constitution.

Compelled labor is by definition slavery. It's specifically used as punishment in the 13th Amendment: ""Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, *except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted* (emphasis added), shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.""

The whole practice is horrifying."
"It's amazing that people are defending slavery for goods they used, and are getting support on reddit for it.


I guess let's just keep on using slaves when we the opportunity arises, according to Redditors in this thread.


We already have one, might as well just have global slavery then.


WTF "
"Lol.  There are less prisoners working for private corporations than working for some middling regional grocery chain.

They're also required to be paid at least minimum wage."
"Exactly. I find it strange how people are hard on other countries and then act like there isn't a problem at home. Reformation should be the goal with prison time, not exploitative punishment."
The pay that is given to prisoners 100% needs to be reworked. Less would probably go back if they could make more than a couple dollars per day
McDonald's wrappers
Yeah but in the US slavery is still legal under the 13th amendment as a punishment for a crime.
Yes. Slavery exception clause in our fucking Constitution.
"That is my problems with posts like this. Everyone is so concerned with how another country does business that they don’t care what happens in their own backyard. What about the poultry plants hiring kids, nobody seems to care about that or what about states trying to lower the age requirement for working. It is just crazy."
There is a big difference between criminals and slave labor. Criminals made the choice. Period.
Should convicted criminals just sit around all day?
"Do you buy clothes that are manufactured in the States?

  
If not, slave labor is used to make your clothes."
"No cocoa, no coffee."
"Nah, it doesn’t. It just offshores the manufacturing because laws like that are very carefully written to leave loopholes for derivatives of those products. I see it all the time in the chemical industry - EU bans a chemical from being imported into the EU, but they’ll happily import products that are chemically derived from them as long as the reaction takes place outside the EU. So they do technically protect themselves from direct exposure, but they do it by offloading the more dangerous and unsavory work to places with poor worker rights, like India and China.

None of this is going to stop as long as people want to keep using the end product, and they’ll keep wanting to because they don’t have a choice. Employment in the USA requires a car. Jobs… anywhere, require a phone. People need planes, they need food."
Yes but with far less self awareness haha
"Exactly, it’s like that on purpose cuz corporations benefit off these things, so they’ll just stealthily do the exact bad thing in a different country instead. 


Like Apple shifting manufacturing from China to Vietnam or India is portrayed as some kind of win, when in reality they’re doing it because Chinese workers are beginning to expect more and it’s more profitable to exploit other countries with workers who expect less."
"Yup, I like the KZ earbuds which are made by a normal Chinese company, but every time I have to specify that it's a normal company and that they aren't closed or anything."
"Tbf, China bad too"
China is controlled by bad people.
"But why specifically temu?  Why not Nestle? Amazon?  Apple?  Like you probably name just about every major company about sourcing parts from China which will have a very high probability of using child/slave labor.  Considering that temu is more small potatoes compared to the likes of Amazon, it seems there is an separate motive behind targeting that specific company."
"Why specifically Temu then? Its not even a particularly big company. Have they stopped using Nestlé, Amazon and Nike products, aka much bigger companies that also use slaves or exploited labor? It smells like anti-sinitic rhetoric where being anti-exploitation is only reserved for Chinese-based companies when basically every corporation does it"
"Nope.

We cannot solve ANY pressing issue in this country with any sense of urgency.

But a Chinese company made an app where people watch 30 second videos?? I’ve never seen a bill pushed through both Houses and signed by the President in record time.

All we ask is that you use that urgency towards everything.

It’s not a menu."
It's a common right wing tactic designed to prevent any change from occuring
"The problem is that it's the wrong ball. It's not about slavery. It never was. It's about a Chinese company selling same old crap you have been buying for well over a decade, but directly. Cutting out the middlemen, and now the middlemen are pissed.

Temu doesn't run the sweatshops, they just buy from them. Same as Amazon(and their sellers), same as Wallmart. But now it's suddenly a problem.

Edit: [Here are two episodes of certain podcast covering Temu and its fascinating history.](https://podtail.com/podcast/it-could-happen-here/it-could-happen-here-weekly-120/) Linking to a weekly compilation, because no mid-roll ads. They are the first two episodes. TLDR: Temu is bad, but in a very hypercapitlist way."
Idk if you’ve been reading this thread. The majority of what I’m seeing is that it should be banned everywhere.
"This isn’t true, the ali express chibsons are made out of plywood and stuff, and have nothing in common with major brand import guitars. 

the factories that Ibanez, prs, epiphone, etc use have video tours on YouTube, they’re perfectly fine"
"This can be true, but usually isn't. Brands that have reputations to protect and and shareholders to answer to can, and often do, face pressure to ensure certain working conditions.


Is that a good, reliable solution? No. Is it better than whatever local sweat shop owner is grinding their workforce down to make cheap temu guitars? Almost certainly yes. "
"I am such an anal online shopper. I’ve gotten so much cool stuff digging through Etsy but you’re right about it being full of questionable crap. It’s makes it hard to find the legit stuff.

The good stuff on there though is really good. Hand painted bike bells from Germany. Wood art from Ukraine. Handmade panniers from London. Enamel pins from Canada, Poland, and Singapore. 3d printed cat bike tire caps from US. Etc. Quality American made silver jewelry."
100% right.
"You can search ""Nestle bad"" and find multitude of terrible things they've done. Here's this for starters: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversies_of_Nestl%C3%A9"
"They gave free samples of baby formula to mothers in Africa and told them it's the best thing since sliced bread, thing is that the mother stopped producing milk themselves and in Africa clean water isn't abundant. So babies started to die by all kinds of horrible diseases and mothers couldn't feed their kids because they'd stopped producing milk. And to top it all off, Nestle stopped with the free samples for those with access to clean water. Nestle literally got the kids hooked on baby formula.

Their CEO also said that Water isn't a human right, while Nestle is literally sucking some areas of the world dry of water for pennies on the dollar thanks to corruption or outright negligence from the local government."
/r/FuckNestle
Yeah I’ve not heard about anything with Nike since they were basically forced to do a supply chain overhaul. This was a thing in the early 2000s unless I’m mistaken.
"If I’m not mistaken, this (Nike’s ‘progress’) is true of Microsoft as well (in context of Apple). Usually when a corporation gets caught, they’ll do something to course correct. It’s not ever enough to be ethical but it’s comparatively better than their competitors. It’s like an ethical arms race but takes all of the consumers’ effort to keep it inching along."
So the argument is Nike already made it big?
"What I want to know is which companies are we NOT avoiding? Say I need running shoes and I’d like them to not completely break the bank. Where am I getting them? 

Because yes, it makes sense that we should avoid companies who utilize slave labor, but when you look around and it feels like it’s all of them, it becomes really difficult to navigate."
"Nike also just makes very poor quality items. Every pair of Nike cleats, sneakers, and wrestling shoes I ever wore was way too narrow and wore out quick"
"You’re not going to avoid any of these logistics and manufacturing chains unless you thrift everything or spend a shit ton of money. You’re not going to do that. 

And then there’s tech which relies on similar and often worse labor practices to which there’s no option other than just not buying anything."
"They're mentioning Temu because China.

Just like TikTok. It gets put on trial because China.

I'm so fucking sick of Americans getting on a high horse about China when we have our own concentration camps and slave labor and still use all the services that rely on it without boycotts. (To say nothing of the genocide apologists - you know the situation, and you know who you are.)

Boycott Temu or don't, but do not pretend it's about any moral high ground outside of yellow peril racism when you're all still sticking your head in the sand or performing serious cognitive dissonance to continue to use US based companies guilty of the same and worse."
"The difference is slavery and slavery with extra steps. One of these is worse than the other, but both are awful."
That didn’t answer the question though.
I'm pretty sure Nike isn't immune.
How did the tariffs fail? Biden is adding even more tariffs on top of what Trump already did
"I actually like a lot of Chinese store fronts, I’ve had a weird obsession with Chinese street fashion, or Chinese takes on Japanese street fashions, for quite a while.  Not everything from china is inherently bad, there’s actual, legit businesses that operate in china who use more ethical factories or well paid labourers. 

But, anything for that price point will be slave labour - temu taking losses or not. Even so, most for profit business want to keep overhead costs as low as possible and do not care for the ethical implications. The issue isn’t with china specifically, it effect’s so many other countries - including products made inside the us. Companies at fault aren’t going to change their business practices.  We need to vet the places we consume from because slave labour is pervasive everywhere, it’s not a china bad issue it’s an issue with capitalism and consumerism."
"I signed up with a law office somewhere for a class action suit against temu, but haven't heard anything about it yet..."
How are TikTok and Temu any different than Twitter and Amazon? Genuinely curious why the spyware and data harvesting is a problem for the former but not the latter.
you're real for this one bestie
"
""The Chinese oligarchs are taking over!"" - US oligarchs probably"
"You’re completely right but that wasn’t the official reasoning for doing it, because that would be unconstitutional as hell. Instead they found a reason but only applied it to one app instead of the other apps which do the same thing. Not to mention how American apps do the same shit"
This is a fair point I’ve noticed. People seem to be more quick to criticize foreign-based companies for the same practices.
"I will say from a government legal prospective - subpoenaing records or data from Google or trying to get them to follow certain regulations - is a hell of a lot easier than trying to get any of that information from China. That’s the big concern from the government’s prospective. I would rather Google have my information than ByteDance (best would be if no one did, but that’s not the world we live in, it seems)"
">the only companies that ever seem to get called out for regulatory action on these issues are non-western.


Like how you hear about ""Chinese propaganda"" and ""Russian bots"", but when America says something, it's true."
"People call out Western companies all the time, especially Amazon which was basically the face of corporate exploitation with low wages, forcing workers in piss in bottles, etc. 

Criticizing China/companies in China is not evidence of anti-Chinese bias, it’s simply giving out the same criticisms we’ve handed out to Western companies. 

And of course our politicians are more likely to regulate foreign companies - those companies don’t have nearly the same support or influence on voters as domestic companies, so there’s a much greater incentive to attempt to fight their awful practices."
big difference between who ends up having your data in those instances.
Yes because an equal amount of data harvesting in an American company and in a company owned by our greatest geopolitical adversary have different consequences. It makes all the sense in the world America would have it out for TikTok over google.
"I see plenty of western companies called out for unethical practices all the time. Amazon and WalMart are criticized heavily, and boycotted by many. There are absolutely calls for regulatory intervention, although it is generally focused on how these companies treat domestic workers."
"Google is an American private company, TikTok is Chinese owned and almost certainly feeds the data right to the Chinese communist party. Not to mention it intentionally promotes content that inspires hate and division.
Not the same thing."
"Temu is bad!

- sent from Android"
"Yuuuuuuup. Western companies use slave labor: "" naughty naughty, sure wish you wouldn't""

Eastern companies use slave labor: ""KILL THEM WITH FIRE, WE HAVE TO GET THIS COMPANY BANNED!""

(Both are fucking awful is the point, I'm not defending either)"
I don't think the person you replied to thinks the people who are only bringing up other issues are doing whataboutism
"If people don’t buy from Temu, they’ll buy from AMZN at 50% higher prices, bc the goods are coming from the same source."
"I expect them to buy fewer crappily constructed clothes and less pointless clutter, but the problem is that people are so miserable under late stage capitalism that buying things is sometimes their only source of joy. This issue is interconnected to various other problems everyone except the 1% billionaires are facing. Whataboutism is never “relevant” (it’s objectively a bad and silly conversational tactic) but even if it were, people are asking the wrong “whatabout”.

Slave labour isn’t going to stop if we put incremental legislation into place. It’ll stop if we all quit participating in capitalism. That’s the only way."
"Amazon is the worst, like literally, they do this kind of crap in countries and in countries like The Netherlands they can't even get their products delivered when they say they should be able to deliver them. They are the one store that cannot  meet their own next day delivery time"
You also have the workers that died when they were not allowed to seek shelter from a hurricane. 
Exactly what I was thinking.  All Temu did is preventing Amazon from making more money.  They are already a more worse evil than Walmart.
 Hundredaire here....
"Lol, you haven't worked for that many small business owners. They definitely don't pay any more than mega corps by me.

"My 17 year old goes out with his friends (mostly females) and hits 4-5 goodwills a couple times a month. I’ve been doing it too for things like furniture. I found a vintage 60s coffee table for $25 in near perfect condition. I’ve found great deals on cast iron pans and Dutch ovens. Of course most of stuff at good will is just absolute crap people should have thrown away, but maybe some hoarder will buy most of it."
i live in a US reservation and the city is 1h30min away from me :(. the city is small and the thrift stores are always messy and a lot of the stuff is from shein anyways so :( i try to buy ethically but it's hard not to choose stuff from shein and amazon when you live remote and are poor
"The thrift stores in my area are scams. I was seriously so pissed when I went to look for an outfit to put together for a one-time event. Their prices on used, dingy clothes were more expensive than new clothes from sites like Shein."
"People dont need clothes now? Their point stands, and 90% of our clothes come from the same sweat shops anyways, no shame on them buying it at a discount."
"Your completely right it’s very hard for the average human in the us the 99 percent or whatever to band against global multinational companies that have been developing & evolving to take and take for a hundred years, I think looking outward is a small part of it, the average consumer to the elite
is just a consumer
meant to prop up the GDP & take money from, the system isn’t broken it’s working, just not in your favor or mine"
"The politicians don't care. Lots of people, too. Jim Justice converted a federally funded COVID surplus into a ""gift"" and spent it on a new baseball stadium.

Hell I’d say parts of Appalachia are 3rd world. I’ve met people here without running water.
Stop calling out my living conditions you fuck. I'm glad I can exploit slaves in other countries to make my living conditions slightly better. Give me a few more years and the town I'm in is either completely dead or just another dumpster.
which apps? pretty sure China has all of their own versions of apps.
"There’s absolutely reason to ban Temu that goes beyond products being unethically sourced and produced, though.

Temu is substantially worse than TikTok when it comes to malware and spyware, and how they use that user data. 

Ofc unethical production won’t cause the government to act, but the data mining might. It goes beyond individual privacy and starts becoming a national security risk."
"Dude Temu is eating Amazon and Walmarts lunch because it's just doing what they're doing better as it ships straight from the factory. You know what that means right? Some good old fashion lobbying baby! Lol


Watch, give it like 2 years and both parties are going to start crying about how temu is harvesting your data as an excuse to ban it well doing jack shit for the average person except making their lives slightly yet constantly worse."
Because the tik tik ban has nothing to do with queer kids and the moron is just obsessed with victimhood 
They are banned in China. China would never allow a foreign internet company exert influence over its citizens.
Because they line congresses pockets.
You're replying to a comment that was obviously sarcasm.
"Yes, that's the joke."
I was thinking advanced analytics is data harvesting and flexible supply chains are worker exploitation but you get the point either way
Yeah I'm starting to get annoyed with it. You can't even look for brand name merchandise without having to go through pages of cheap Chinese shit first
"some of it is absolutely temu crap. i bought a tv stand off amazon for $40, it literally fell apart if you moved it, they expected just wooden dowels & crappy glue to hold the thing together. i wasn’t expecting that to last very long and it still under-performed.

i normally have my tv wall mounted, had to put the new one on the stand for a day while i waited for hardware and the top panel permanently bent down ever since.

if you shop around the “I could conceivably get something like this from ikea” price range, there’s some decent stuff mixed in there. the chinese are sometimes very good at making flat-pack furniture. my replacement tv stand was more like $120 and for that price you get normal ikea-grade cam locks and a much closer to convincing grade of fake wood."
"Literally all these online marketplaces are the same.

Even Etsy is now just 90% dropshipped Chinese shit."
"Whaaaat? You mean my Flashlight and Socks from a company called GUYSBAKZ isn't an American company???

But seriously, I WISH Amazon could let us filter that shit. It sucks if you're just trying to buy 1 thing and have to sort through endless amounts of bullshit companies. Like seriously, just from the top options of flashlight it's AlpsWolf, QIUJIN, Etekcity, Anker, WDTPRO, like enough already"
"These days, yeah. It wasn't always this bad, but dropshipping has taken over. Same for Etsy, etc too."
a lot of it is but also a lot of it is just stealing pictures from amazon and selling the “same thing” on sites like temu
"i would be shocked if amazon isn’t trying to manipulate the “china scary!” rush to make money.

"My wife has a knack for finding custom to order clothes made by small American boutique shops. Stuff like wishuponaboutique.com and others that are similar.

I would guess that over half my kids’ wardrobes consist of these outfits. It feels nice supporting people like that, too"
"Capitalism always tends to corruption though. People act like cronie capitalism is not real capitalism, even though it is quite obvious.

In 2024 the “progressive” humans can only have the society we do from slavery. Shits gotta change."
Or the chocolate we eat.
Prison labor is actual slave labor too
"Slave labor is slave labor.  Prison slave labor is slave labor.

Dafuq is this ""no not that slave labor""?"
"...are you arguing that being compelled to work for under $1 a day that you don't actually control isn't ""actual slavery?"""
Not to mention vapes that have no battery recycling process.
They are both actual slave labor.
"13th amendment literally reads that slavery is abolished, *unless you are in prison.*

Why do you think that prison populations (especially following the civil war) were predominantly black? Why do you think “loitering” became a crime? It’s because the southern states especially were looking for ways to put the now freed slaves back to work."
Anyone who is forced to do labor “or else” is a slave.
"""Actual slave labor"" occurs in US prisons daily"
"""actual slave labor"" lol

I understand the point you're trying to make, but forced prison labor IS ""actual slave labor"" by literally all definitions."
"Prison labour is also ""actual slave labour"", constitutionally sanctioned"
"Prison labor is slave labor, it's literally written into the constitution as such."
"Prison labor is *actually* slavery. There’s an exception to the amendment outlawing slavery and involuntary servitude as punishment for people who have been convicted of a crime. These workers have few worker protections, if they’re paid at all it’s barely anything (they have to rely on people on the outside when a fair wage could be supporting their families on the outside), and incarcerated people are often required to work. They just don’t have a say in the matter."
"The prison industrial complex is *literally* codified slavery. Wdym ""actual"" slavery? You don't get to say ""oh, well we're fucking up the Congo worse so we get to do slavery"" lol"
"Child slaves in ghana and the ivory coast cost about 50 bucks a pop and you can just work them to death as a Nestle contractor. Our stores are full of pol pot candy bars. Nobody cares. 


lol china isn't doing anything we haven't been doing for years. People don't hate them because they use slave labor like we do. People hate them because they want them to be slave labor for us and china has other ideas."
"Literally arrested and convicted blacks after they were ""free""  so that they could be used as labour .    Us legal system is strongly rooted slavery especially the south and it still is"
"The prisoners are ***actual slaves*** as well.  The 13th Amendment explicitly permits slavery if you have been convicted of a crime.  And we all know how fair the US criminal courts are to the accused, especially the poor and minorities..."
That is also slave labor. Just because you did something wrong does not mean you deserve to be treated as less than human.
">We're the only first world nation that uses the actual word ""slavery"" in its constitution.

It's definitely in the [UK constitution](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/United_Kingdom_2013), though I could understand the argument of not including them as a first world nation. ;)

To be fair, I don't think their exceptions list is as broad as ours is. I also found that many nations have incorporated either partially or completely the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) which absolutely prohibits slavery in all forms and without exception."
"People should look up the ""Black Codes"" (which are distinct and different from Jim Crow) and how that has shaped the legal system that affects poor people to this day. Slavery outside of prisons only ended in 1947 and it's not even illegal in the US."
just dont go to prison who fucking cares
They’re supposed to go back. We specifically design our prisons for maximum recidivism.
"In FL prisons the only paid inmate positions are the commissary operators. 

The other 99.99% of inmates are forced to work."
"Are you implying that all countries that make clothes are doing that with slave labour, and that the US is the only country that doesn't?

Honestly, if that's the case, that's one of the most insane examples of American Exceptionalism I've ever seen on here."
"There was a news story ages ago about jeans made with prison labor right here in the United States. 

We've got our domestic slave labor right here. 

And a lot of the discourse about ""illegal aliens invading"" is really just a pretext to amp up the imprisonment of undocumented workers, so instead of paying them unfair wages for unreasonable hours, we can effectively pay them no wages and work them as much as they can without actually dying.

Not disagreeing with anyone on anything, just... Holy cow so much bad stuff happening everywhere. :(

Here's a link for the curious: https://www.just-style.com/features/americas-questionable-employment-of-prison-labour-is-adding-to-domestic-clothing-makers-woes/"
"they will just move the goal posts at what "" slave labour "" means so we can still have it."
"Nah man, China's awesome. The people in power are terrible. But that's almost universally true of everywhere."
Just like America

"We have to start somewhere. The starting point is never going to look fair. We can't just say 

""Well, since we havent banned all forced labor yet, we can go ahead and let the chinese companies keep doing it cause it would be kinda rude to that business to ban it first.""

It easier for us to outright ban foreign companies vs US based ones too. Until we get some legislation changed here the most they could really do is fine nestle, which we all know would do fucking nothing."
"It’s BECAUSE Temu is the new trendy piece of shit and is relatively small potatoes as you said. They are an easier target for banning. 

The others you mentioned are so ridiculously entrenched that it would take political action that hasn’t been seen since the 30s to get rid of them.

They all need to go, but I don’t even think we have the political motivation to ban Temu, let alone the rest. So start small with what you can and move up from there."
"The tiktok ban is 100% about controlling information, I firmly believe Twitter was also sabotaged for similar reasons. 

Mitt Romney all but said it out loud."
that statement is a common centrist tactic designed to keep things from progressing too far
There’s some solid logic to it though. We can’t ban all slave labor products lest we are willing to give up our current lifestyles. People (me included honestly) are not willing.
"Thank you for bringing up Amazon. Their recommendations for you are a result of data mining. The same way social media platforms do. 

I work under the assumption that all of my data is out there because my employer was hacked, most major companies have been packed as well has health networks. The best a person can do is to keep a credit freeze on and request a pin from the IRS (if you’re in the US) to file taxes. Also use a VPN, anti virus, etc."
People look at me like I've got six heads when I explain to them the things you can buy on SheIn are the same items on Amazon
"You've nailed it. People didn't have a problem buying the same products through a US middleman who upped the price. Now that China is selling more directly to us, we enjoy the cost savings but now seem to care about labor practices."
"I reverse image search product pics from Etsy to see if they’re on any other shops. If they aren’t, I generally take that as a sign that the shop is legit"
"you have to dig through a good amount of slog, but there really are still some GEMS on etsy that deserve the recognition (and money) for their art!"
Yep. I won’t dig it up now cuz it’s been a while. But Nike and Adidas are two of the cleanest supply chains now BECAUSE of the scrutiny they faced. The worst? No surprise but it’s the big luxury brands like Prada and Coach.
A couple years back Nike and Apple opposed a US law that would require companies to avoid suppliers and contractors if they were known to use slave labor practices. It is hard to find companies that are avoid slave labor and that is pathetic.
Why is it a competition?
Learn 2 read
"no, that's not the argument they were making. pay attention in english class"
"No, the argument is boycott Nike too"
there is no argument. both are bad
The argument is that you can stay away from Nike and Temu
"Cue the plot of The Good Place 😅 you’re right, it’s really hard to navigate. I personally use a website called “Good on You” where they’ve have ranked the labor practices of different companies, and then scour sales of the better companies when I need new items. I buy probably 90% of stuff second hand, but when I need something new, I’ve been really lucky getting affordable things from more ethical companies just by waiting for the right sale moment and shopping based on need vs. trend. 

But at the end of the day this is all still an imperfect solution. Sometimes you do need something immediately, or you might still not find things in your price range. So in that case, just doing the least harm you’re able to in a situation is the way to go. Because Nike is the worst offender in terms of athletic shoes, you’re really making a more ethical choice by buying almost anything other than them, so that alone is an action that’s worth something."
"And that’s exactly why thrifting is the way to go when you can!! Also, just harm reduction principles in general. You’ll never avoid everything, just do your best with the parameters you have."
"You know, this is the only fair argument against OP I’ve seen made. Great point, 100% agree."
In five years you'll get a check for around three dollars.
Tiktok and Temu are owned by Chinese companies. That’s the only difference
"We never outright left the McCarthy era in this regard. The argument for a lot of these things is, first and foremost, that they’re Chinese based. Like yeah, data mining and slave labor sucks and shouldn’t be a thing, but our politicians are lil bitches who love money, so McCarthyism it is (but all hail Meta and Google)"
"thats a weird stance to me, the data bytedance has of you can ever only be used to try and sell you shit because you dont live in china and china thus has no legal power over you. 

on the flip side any data google has of you can be had by the us gov and used against you in any way they want. 

so realistically the domesticly held data about you is far more dangerous. 

and to me this whole thing boild down to, either clean your own house first or stfu about others doing the same thing you do."
"From the European point of view we would prefer to not get anything from either of them, but we have a lot less choice then xD"
"If you think that Google doesn't feed data to the US government then you're too far gone for me to tell you that you fell for propaganda.

Also, Facebook does the same thing. They also took money from Russia to rig the elections in 2012, caught in 2013, then the 2016 election, caught in 2017, the 2020 election, caught in 2021... But this election certainly they won't!

All the data you gave Twitter some billionaire just like, bought last year.

Idk, why does China having our info seem bad when it's proven that the US government is WAY worse about it? All the companies listed above also sell your information to China btw. 

I get wanting privacy, but your anger is pointed in the wrong direction. You have more in common with the people who made TikTok/Temu than the people who banned it. Remember that."
You don't think Google feeds information directly to American intelligence agencies? You don't think Facebook and Instagram intentionally promote divisive content to promote engagement and sell ads? What world are you living in?

If you’re going to complain about logical fallacies in a thread you should really specify what arguments you’re mad at because I haven’t see anything I’d call whataboutism in the top comments
How do we quit participating in capitalism of we're poor?
People are struggling under late stage capitalism. and don’t have the means to buy “fewer crappily constructed clothes.” Let me know the price of something ethically sourced. $30-$40 for a T-shirt probably.
"The clothes on Temu aren’t that bad in quality though.  

If Temu gets banned, I’d just buy the cheap clothes from somewhere else. Pandabuy, Hoobuy, DHGate, whatever.  

The point these others are making is banning Temu wouldn’t stop me or other consumers from consuming chinese products.  

Idk about you, I prefer paying 10$ for a shirt than 50. Especially when, as far as I’ve seen, the quality is the same.  

Same for Nike replicas."
"Yeah ok, just get the majority of the world to quit participating in capitalism. So what replaces it?

No one WANTS to work in a shoe factory.
The state forces people to work in the shoe factory. 
Congratulations, slavery again."

I honestly think 90% of his votes come from our love of his stupid dog. Lmao
"It wouldn't surprise me. I am more familiar with factory towns (because I live outside a former one) and we have running water and the basics. However, wages are ""second world"" levels compared to other areas in the states among having other issues like terrible infrastructure, corruption, crime and bad schools. 

It'd be worse there, given they have always sort of been like that to varying degrees. Money has never flowed through those hills."
I’m in Texas I’m and I’ve met plenty without water or electricity
They want to ban TikTok because they don't want outside influences pretty much.
"Temu doesn't ship straight from manufacturer, that's ali baba, not to be confused with Ali express, which is just like temu and wish except with slightly more buyer protection"
This is the correct answer finally
Discord isnt even profitable lmao
"All of those products, including the branded ones, are usually made in the same factory."
"It adds so much danger to getting an off brand product that it seems too risky even with the savings, then I'm back to considering just being safe and buying the overpriced name brand option. It...sucks."
"figure any ""flat pack"" stuff is made out of formaldehyde glue which is toxic.  And no one is checking for it.    It is also a petrochemical product."
I got crap from Amazon and walmart too. Nobody wants solid heavy furnishings anymore bc rents skyrocked ecery state and getting worse. Moving constantly most folks. A disabled person cannot apply for andvi affordable  housing a joke
"Anker makes good products. I've purchased many over the last several years.  Wall chargers, cables, portable charging bricks... their products are good quality for a good price."
Wow when did that happen? Ethical sourcing of beans was one of the things they were most proud of when I worked there
">they are probably better now at covering it up.
And say something like: ""Starbucks is now pleased to partner with local farms in sourcing our Coacoa. The farms have promised us ethical treatment of their employees."""
"Question is, What we can do about it (like actual action, groups doing stuff, places they need people), Cuz people wanna do stuff (but they don't know what will help, if better to be left to people who know or are already acting, if our actions without checking with involved people would just be more of an obstruction), But they don't know what to do (but would if they knew, to the extent they could cuz people even do part time whatsapp stuff n def a lot of people are jobless and can travel to volunteer if it's comped but don't know where to look for, and def a lot of people are willing to act on but don't know where

So what can't we do, where (any groups who are looking, have a diagram of steps, but need people and support), and how do we stop these places, give support, while trying to protect and keep the people helping safe (so security group, protection support too?) well ?"
"> In 2024 the “progressive” humans can only have the society we do from slavery. Shits gotta change.

"was fresh on the mind wasn’t a comparison my bad. 


I think my idea was it’d be harder to make a list of industries that don’t have some kind of bad ties to third world labor exploitation. The world is built on it."
In the United States prisoners are the legal exception to the slavery ban.  Perhaps they meant it isn’t illegal slavery per our constitution.
I was sitting here vaping like an idiot and.... wow... looked into it... thank you for opening my eyes.
Not to mention the fact that most od the time prisoners in China provide did nothing wrong 
"I’m guessing you were a prisoner at some point. US prisons provide rooming, food, clothing, tablets, cable, and pay for the inmates. Being required to provide a service for the free ride they get is NOT slave labor. They committed a crime. They’re incarcerated. It’s not a free ride. Maybe we should send them a bill at the end of their incarceration for the charges they racked up while in prison. They can pay that rather than work for a few hours a day…You dont want to be a “slave” in the prison system? Don’t commit a crime and you so t be required to actually contribute to your life’s expenses."
To be fair the U.K is pretty much a single wealthy city with the rest of the country being Mississippi levels of poor. I can see the argument for them not being first worlders.
"THIS. Plus watch “POWER” on Netflix about policing as it relates to race, class and property. 

Side note: It’s an amazingly enlightening documentary with a bad title choice. It brings to mind “Power” on STARZ by 50 Cent."

Wait… Child rapists are making my clothes? Disgusting!

"Start with companies who have been doing it longer, your basically actively helping the established slavery companies by eradicating their competition and then we both know NOONE is going to attempt to take those down because NOONE EVER HAS."
"It is easier to ban the ones from other countries but its easier to actually crack down on the companies based in the US right? If we ban temu and some company just becomes a middle man for getting that shit here, did we actually do anything other than make ourselves feel better? Ban slavery except when it directly benefits a US company is not the take I'm after."
We don’t start with targeting specific companies. We start by creating community structures that eliminate the need for companies like this among our communities.
"Plus Amazon in particular is made up of a million different independent sellers who would just go elsewhere or change their name or something. Same with Wish and AliExpress. Once there started to be some pushback against Wish some years ago, we just got Shein and now Temu, and saw all those small Chinese sellers moving to Amazon and more recently Etsy. Etsy is now 90% cheap mass produced crap at an insane markup while Etsy turns a blind eye and allows sellers to still advertise shit as ""handmade."" It sucks to see it happen.



Anyway, yes, it must be much easier to go after these companies before they become as huge as Amazon. And if we can't stop the huge companies, we can at least go after the smaller ones that keep cropping up."
"Are you comfortable saying to someone's face, ""I support slavery because it supports my lifestyle?"" Would you do it right now? If not, maybe rethink this comment."
You're talking about the **Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act**. Basically a lot of people (still) don't believe that China uses forced labor from imprisoned Uyghur's.  Nike and Apple opposed the Act because they didn't want to acknowledge that fact and risk straining their business relationship with China.
"It's not, all slavery is bad. Temu and Nike are equally bs"

"I mean, realistically- there’s my data personally, but there’s also data about the US as a collective. Overall, I do worry about how algorithms function in terms of what they show us. I believe we are persuaded a lot more easily than we might think. Humans are actually pretty dumb. I believe they not only have the data we are aware of, like demographics, but they in theory could be able to see data on a national scale in terms of what US citizens are thinking. That worries me."
"I’m not saying that. What I am saying is that I’d rather allow a country that respects civil liberties to do that, than give that data to the social credit using, uyghur muslim slaughtering and authoritarian China"

We had multiple supply chains where some were from farms which promised no slave labor and were sometimes checked, this is not 100% sure no slave labor as checks can be cheated on. Majority of the supply chains was from unchecked farms which was pretty much always slave labor. 

Starbucks pays the premium price for the supply chain without slave labor however the product of both chains end up in the same storage areas so you are not sure whether the produce for the clients comes from slave labor or not."

"Without massive street protests in several countries nothing will change. China and African countries will say that is their culture and to stop interfering with how they do things.

"We need numbers to form a movement. There's a fair bit of talking points from both the left and right in this comment section alone... Those of us in the middle see what's wrong with both sides.

This process would be agonizingly slow, and constantly threatened by the formidable forces working tirelessly every day to silence/invalidate/intimidate/discourage the voice of the middle.

There's a lot of *hard* work to be done. Establishing such a coalition would only be the very beginning of the work. Next, you need to pull sizeable factions from EVERY state into the coalition. Only then could we begin to have a voice big enough for things like constitutional amendments...

I happen to be a millennial. I've been discouragingly convinced it won't be my generation who turns the ship around. It will require tons of discipline and sacrifice.

"That reminds me of the chocolate situation. Jordan Harbinger did a (podcast) episode on chocolate that is just heartbreaking. There are flaws in the system that says the (“good” labeled) chocolate comes from a good farm but it gets mixed with other beans.

"As somebody who is definitely not GenZ but stumbled across this post from the front page, Raising awareness is good and all, but really the main thing to do at your age is to study in school and focus on becoming a respected member for society.

Being in a position where one's influence will actually create societal impact is always going to be more impactful than screaming into the echo chamber void.

This starts with doing well in school, then trying to make an honest living, then becoming someone who becomes respected by others, using your respect and influence to change your local sphere, and then ultimately leveraging that respect and influence to affect greater society.

You can gain respect and influence by becoming a good employee and then ultimately rising in position to having a say in company matters, by becoming an entrepreneur, by becoming someone who has a wealth of experience of an everydayman, by becoming someone who has a career of volunteering and enacting actionable community solutions, etc

Rome wasn't built in a day and neither does fixing complicated societal problems. Start first by convincing your family and friends. If you cannot convince them because they don't believe you are qualified or old enough or experienced enough or even just agree with your solutions, you certainly won't be able to convince strangers nevermind even have them listen to you. Then go on to convincing others you interact with beyond your friends. Then go on and on and on. Everytime you run into a ""why don't people listen to me AND change their actions"" think about what qualifications it would take to have them listen to you? What qualifications it would take to have them change their actions.

Or you can just boycott and change your own personal habits and make online posts, but at the end of the day that's mostly just performative, to make yourself feel better, and try to convince yourself that you are not complicit in the greater will of society as opposed trying to go about the much more difficult path of enacting realistic change."

"I was about to comment something similar but way more harsh. Adorable that OP commenter views product supression and geo politics in such a way. They should go read the ToS for TikTok and Temu and learn something about what is essentially the West/East Cold war 2.0 before whining on reddit that the big bad US Gubberment just doesn't want to you have it for information purposes which is moronic. Read comment history, wish I didn't"
"Agreed. I have a printer that's about 10 years old. It still works but prints streaks. I want to repair it but it seems impossible. Nobody does it. It's so much easier to buy a new one. 

So what can one do? There no market for repairing things like this."
It really doesn't get mentioned enough. I've recently started trying repair anything I reasonably can primarily for environmental reasons and it's awesome how easy and cheap it is in so many cases. Also it's not like it matters if you break it since it was destined for the dump anyway. All you really need is a decently steady hand and some patience.
"100% agree.  That’s why you’ll find me in my local thrift shop, checking the labels to see where things were made (the best are old clothes with the ILGWU label, union made).  
F Temu!"
Boycotts are collective actions though?
"I’m so sick of people acting like we have no power or responsibility. In order for change to occur you need to actually show you care. That means voting with your wallet and voting for your representatives. 

Acting like you can’t do anything as an individual is just a justification for perpetuating this thing. If you actually care, make the sacrifices in your life to prove to yourself, your community, your government, and the corporations that are profiting off of the practices.

Saying that individual action can’t do anything is like saying my vote doesn’t matter. It’s true until everyone starts acting like it isn’t. Then suddenly you have massive societal shifts. Imagine if we didn’t have a civil rights movement and just waited for the government to fix shit."
"Goodwill gets hate because they:
-pay their special needs employees less than minimum wage (one of their only “charitable” actions)
-price things ludicrously expensive in most areas, and pick out anything decent for their online auction site.

Thrift stores ARE the shit, giant corporate thrift store like goodwill savers/value village are shit. 

I personally only spend my money/donate at local ones that provide a real safety net for the communities they operate in."
"Nah, if you have the time garage sales are where it's at. Not only will you almost certainly save money but you're giving the money to a local as well."

"Those are good sources, I suggest you read them. "
"Because tbh America's best was when she had an enemy and she was at war. China is the new ""big bad."" Any move towards equality (or any moves by china to secure it's own interests) is seen as an adversarial or even hostile act because we are used to the privilege of being the best. 

I think it's ironic that American companies tried to maximize wealth and outsourced manufacturing and made billions in profits off of paying cents for dollar goods and when china started to beat them at their own game America suddenly grew a conscience. 

Likewise when you outsource manufacturing to the cheapest producer and get a shoddy product somehow it's Chinas fault but not that of the American companies that exploited the situation. 

It's as you said, it's xenophobia and specifically sinophobia. It's quite baked into our culture at this point."
"I 100% understand your point, but i already responded to this with my original commet. It is hard for the US to do anything quickly against US based companies. Its sort of up to us as citizens to vote any politicians willing to make the legal changes to do that, and that will take time. Right now the government can slap US companies on the wrist and say ""no bad"" but they can't ban them from selling here/wont because our current government is 100% corrupt for them yes.

Is it incredibly hypocritical to ban a chinese company for unethical business practices that US companies use? Fucking yes of course no question.

But I'm not gonna sit here and be like ""Awwww its not Temu's fault they use slaves and kill people. We do it too. Come on guys lets all go say we support keeping temu in business and letting them use slaves until Nestle stops."" Any move to ban any company that uses slave labor is good in my opinion."
"Because they aren’t saying “we need to ban companies that use slavery for their products lol (a reasonable thing) they’re saying “ we need to ban this one specific company”. Which is stupid, that’s a stupid thing to do"
"I wonder if 3-d printing could help reduce barriers to repairs by printing custom extinct parts that previously could only be manufactured in a random factory/facility. Maybe not for the most frustrating machine ever created (printers), but for *something.* Maybe someone will come up with an innovatively simple new printing technology that requires fewer complicated, delicate components...doubt it.

Edit: also who even knows how many parts are designed for planned obsolescence to begin with. What if some of our repair attempts are Sisyphean all along‽"
"The many cannot boycott the few under capitalism because the few have the means to fuck the many so hard they just die. No ethical consumption under capitalism, so let's dismantle capitalism."
Does it count as boycotting if I just don't buy anything because I can't afford anything besides food?
"Historically, boycotts have only ever worked when they have been organized, local, and when those using the service were the ones boycotting it.

The vast majority of people using Temu or these other services don’t know and/or couldn’t give less of a shit about the slave labor compared to the perceived convenience that the services offer them.

The organizations are multi-national, those boycotting it aren’t the ones who use it regularly in the first place, and this theoretical boycott would be either totally unorganized, or done so through random people online.

It’s not going to do anything, a waste of time. If you want to see real, lasting change, form a grassroots political movement to influence local elections. The kind that only need a few hundred votes to swing most of the time. Then state elections. Those are the positions of power that can influence what businesses are and aren’t allowed in specific municipalities.

All it takes is a few thousand people with aligned interests, a clear message, and the ability to get their asses out of their homes and vote every once in a while to cause a lot of change. 

Remember that a solid chunk of the harmful shit that happens at the local governmental level is the result of one or two bored boomers with nothing better to do with their time getting petitions signed. Good things can come from the youth using similar or better methods."
Agreed. I usually donate local thrift stores but I still shop goodwill etc. If the price sucks I just pass on it which happens more often now. Local thrifts prices are always better imo and the people are pretty eclectic. It's crazy they ask for a donation and I always say no.
"Yeah this. I live right up from a goodwill it’s a crap company. They only hire people down on their luck/special needs to take advantage of their situation for crap pay. Their margins are literally 100% and so much is overpriced. 

Anything decent or of more value that comes in the donation bin immediately is sent to a central hub for online auction. So it’s not even worth it to bargain hunt in the stores anymore.

Where those local consignment shop places absolutely rule and you gotta dig but find some amazing items."
"I've noticed that the prices are almost the same or in some cases more than stores like Ross/Burlington etc. It's ridiculous,  don't go there anymore for thrifting."
"Garage sales, estate sales, thrifts, rummage sales. Love em all, and I do get some random good stuff at goodwill but you definitely have to be selective. I keep my budget at about 20-30$ if I go to GW but completely understand why people don't go anymore."
"This is the way. We can not have the nicest things if we don't get our shit together collectivly. Greed and $$ is holding us back now more than incentivizing us to get to work. The people on top love it btw. Its a hard thing to change but we need to. 

Try convincing someone making 20mil a yr that they should only make 10mil a yr. They will most likely kick and scream about it. Its a sickness."
"I mean, some boycotts do work, objectively.

You wanna start the revolution? Go for it, I am down. But personally I think we are nowhere near any of that happening anytime soon. 

So it's best to work how we can until we are.

Perfect vs. Good and all that..."

"Bro, it's Temu. Not official disney merch."
Kinda ironic. Venting about a Chinese company on a Chinese platform.
Why the fuck would you shop at Temu???
It's correct in Temu language.
This is because the character names are not in the original language. The names were localized so those names are in Temunese.

We had a local woman order a nightgown or some article of clothing from Temu and she ended up OD’n while wearing it and ended up in the hospital. Found out that it had fentanyl in the clothing.
How stupid can people be? They can't realize Temu is China's Amazon? They don't mind giving money to the CCP even when they have concentration camps and remove organs from undesirables without anesthesia and put it on the black market.
These socks are kind of amazing 🤣🤣
Nobody reads or care about ur socks tbh
I totally agree. I got to say that he probably got a good deal. Who cares what it says on the bottom? The part you are with a shoe on looks pretty good.

100% true story
"Omg no, i just ordered the cutest apron there 🥲🥲"
"Yes, the normal thing we all know as bigeet"
I'm going to need a source. I googled and nothing pulled up..
"Tested it buying some iPhone cases and immediately hated it, it’s like gambling, the app spam mini games to earn discounts and I think people get addicted to it."
"Dude why are people saying they are getting scammed left and right on Ali, I've been buying stuff on Ali for years and I've never had any trouble, like where are they finding so many shady shops. Just make sure the shop has a decent reputation and that's it, I rather spend 3 seconds looking for the store reviews and amount of sales than giving away personal info to Temu for shitty products"
"It seems it depends on the country and the products you are buying, i like temu because they ship all my stuff together and they arrive in 2 weeks, while with aliexpress if i order more stuff i need to track everything separate, and for some items it takes 1-1.5 months to arrive"
"In my country 


- Temu prices are lower
- Temu prices are more transparent 
- Temu includes taxes
- Temu offers generous coupons that can be used on ANYTHING, no weird restrictions 
- Temu offers generous gifts with purchase (not some crappy junk)
- Temu offers ways to earn generous amounts of credit with purchase (which doesn’t expire or have weird restrictions)
- Temu customer service is easier to reach and much more helpful. Also, The AI bot can can actually solve simple issues and if it can’t, easy to chat to an agent 
- Temu offers easy returns and refunds without problem
- Temu offers price adjustments
- if your order is delivered late, Temu issues credit, which doesn’t expire and can be used on anything 

The Temu pop ups have resulted in me earning a lot of credit, big discounts on items I actually want and free gifts, so I’m quite ok with them

I accept less choice of items for the advantages above. There’s more than enough items I want to buy on Temu

I don’t find AE has major advantages to ordering from China directly"
"When Temu first started getting popular it was pretty good since the shipping time was way faster than Aliexpress at the time. They were also giving a crap ton of discounts and free stuff which made it way better. Nowadays Aliexpress is way better, they improved their shipping times and is way less spammy than Temu. Literally open the Temu app and you’re forced into so many mini-games. The only thing that I guess is better than Ali is their return policy, Ive gotten so many full refunds and get to keep the item."
"Here in Greece, AliExpress takes from 2 weeks up to 2 months. Temu takes only 4-10 days. That’s the main selling point here."
"I dunno, are they?

Depends on where you are located I guess.

From my experience (I shop on Aliexpress, Amazon, Temu and Banggood) they all have their advantages and drawbacks.

I like Aliexpress because it's fairly straight forward, usually really fast shipping and no fuzz finding stuff.

I've used Temu too, but it is a mixed bag for me, shipping is slow (usually takes over 30 days), and their Early bird ships seems to be using an independent contractor for deliveries, my package ended up outside on the main street next to my mailbox 4 o clock in the night, so It could have been picked up by anyone driving by without even entering my property... that's something I'll keep in mind next time.

But my friend says he has only positive experiences with Temu and he lives in the same country as me, and say they're fast.

I do find that Temu has a lot more to select from than Aliexpress, but it seems (to me) like Aliexpress kinda wants to be Amazon and have more serious products and not so much weird stuff (that said - I like weird stuff), so I'll use both."
"In my country Temu arrives within 10 days, while Aliexpress takes 5-8 weeks."
Temu was fun until they introduced a $50 minimum order. Now I don't even consider it.
"It's new platform thing, and especially when big company with a lot of experience  is running the platform, they can afford to splurge on giveaways and new user deals and stuff.

But honestly, they don't have as much of good stuff, I don't think the price is better.  
why would I bother investing into platform that's alrady starting to raise the price of everything and deceive users with low value coupons and you eventually just have to spend way more than you think?

It's same logic as how Mcdonald's set meal works. they don't make profit on simple orders, so they have to make it double, triple and side menus, and give you the illusion of ""value"", but in the end they just make you spend way more than you should've in the first place/

And compared to when they were doing whole influencers deal, they are getting some reputable brands on but basically no official store, and the biggest discounts are new user invites/credits, and if you do too much of them you can't even spend a penny lol. (gives error)

If I had  to say, if Aliex was good ol' YouTube or Bilibili, Temu is TikTok Lite.

The main difference might be the core userbase, people who use aliex is people who is looking for someting specific, and know what they want. Temu is I think designed to make people spend money mindlessly, with whole referral thing and game stuff that pops up.  same with Shein too, there's nothing that I couldn't buy from Aliex for similar or even cheaper without doing all that.

I think eventually the artificial hype around Temu will die down like how Shein did.  people will still use it, sure but imo it doesnt offer value that aliex have offered for over a decade."
"I’m in Australia, if that makes any difference but Temu shipping is fast and reliable. With aliexpress, you don’t even know if your package is going to turn up. Ive switched to Temu because of this. I hate the gamified shopping experience, and it’s slightly more expensive but at least I get my stuff delivered. Aliexpress has been hit or miss.

The best marketplace for similar stuff is actually alibaba, but it’s not a simple checkout process like aliexpress, you need to contact the seller in most cases. But thats where aliexpress sellers get their stock, just so you know."
"I have ordered three things from Temu. One I had to get a refund, which was quick, aka the same day. Perhaps that was because it was my first order. The second item was fine. The third item was next to useless, but I got it at a deal price. 

Both Temu and AE Choice deliver here within 2 weeks. I hate Temu's constant nagging, at least on their mobile app. Despite a YouTuber saying that Temu finds the cheapest seller for a product and only allows them to sell that item on Temu, there are multiple sellers for an item. 

 I use AE by far a lot more since there is no minimum order and AE has many more items I am interested in."
Try getting a refund or settle a dispute with AliExpress it’s damn ne’er impossible and they expect you to do all the work (but you’re the customer!)
Temu is more expensive than aliexpress in my country and there is a a minimum fee to checkout  about $25 currently for me. So if you only need some cheap product then you can't buy it because of that requirement. 
"Temu is ""gamey"" aliexpress is ""annoying"" and the most vocal people are always the ones who got scammed. Temu has a no shits given refund policy, item breaks or doesnt work or is wrong, immediately money back (in temu credit atleast). If u buy stuff enough u get credits back too (like the spend 120 bucks, get 90 bucks back in credit) deal. Aliexpress (sellers) can be very shady and dealing with support and talking to sellers is infact a mess. Getting custom items done is also a hassle. On temu its just ""nice that looks good, *press customize*, *send pic*, *order*, *arrives in a week or so*""
Also that, temu delivery is way faster and way better max 14 days.. Promised, if they dont deliver in 14 days u get $5€ in credit. They also dont send 16 packages per order, they send 1 or 2 at most if its a huge order. They pretty much sell the same stuff as aliexpress when it comes to ""nice to haves"" and ""random gadgets"" but for cheaper. If u want electronics, escooters, ebikes, a multimeter, soldering iron, bike seat, bike lock, SSD, whatever.. Even a mini PC or otherwise, u go to aliexpress. If u are in the market for a chinese *insert electronic/tech/car product here* that is most likely decent enough quality and 20-80% cheaper than elsewhere.. But if u want a hoodie, socks, a kitchen spatula, cutting board, pillow, etc, u go to temu.

Most people who buy on temu are like 13-45+ year old women, the rest are like 13-22 year old men and ofc the like random stragglers. So the demographic isnt ""techspert"" its ""average jess needing a sponge and socks for cheap""

I myself am gonna buy like 200 euros of stuff from aliexpress soon here (for the like 8th time) but thats because Im techy and like electronics. If I need clothes or a mug or whatever i buy from temu. I bought 2 escooters from aliexpress too but wouldnt even dare to buy one from temu.

Ohh and forgot to mention. Price adjustements, if a product u buy for $2€ drops down to $1,25€ u get 75 cents back in credit. And its not just the particular item. If u buy a spatula and a similar one drops u get the adjustement. On alixpress the price u pay is the price u pay

All this could be diff for diff countries but this is the experience i mostly see"
I use both. Pretty much boils down to delivery time. TEMU is faster. Once in awhile I'll find a better deal on TEMU but in general AE has more but is slow.
"as someone that loves temu, i concur, ali is just waaaay better. you just gotta dig/read reviews but the product you get is usually solid."
Cheap prices and you get money back if prices go even down
"I have to agree with you, i buy a lot on AliExpress, like every week i make minimum 1 order (i buy crafting supplies for my business, materials i can't find anywhere) but every goddam time i say that i buy a lot like ""trust me i buy a lot you can buy on AliExpress without issues or anything"" no one gives a fuck they just remember like 10 years ago when the shipping was reaaally slow (5-6 weeks) and say they prefer Temu and blablabla. Honestly i never bought anything from Temu because every single time i look, the same item is cheaper on AliEx. 

AliExpress it is just better. Actually in Italy where i am now, the shipping is ridiculously fast, max 10 days and i have everything.

Some people are just dumb."
"I renewed my whole wardrobe with temu. I like it because:
- it's very easy to track your package
- it's extremely easy to do returns, for free, for any reason
- you get price adjustments
- you don't run the risk of shady sellers
- they ship through the courier instead of mail

Also I find the app interface a lot more user friendly, but maybe that's just me"
"I hane no issue with Temu personally. I use it a lot. Used to use AliExpress all the time but now use Temu more. As for prices, bear in mind AliExpress adds the VAT at checkout. Temu doesn't as prices include it ( I'm in UK). 

Yes they send a lot of email 'offers' but you know you don't have to open them or you can unsubscribe. 

So depending what I'm after I'm happy to use either AliExpress or Temu.

Also, Temu has better customer service than AliExpress. They've never refused to refund an item with an issue. AliExpress not so much."
"Temu operated at a huge loss with their aggressive marketing to enter the online marketing space, aliexpress doesn't need to do that because it already has a decently sized userbase."
"I am a Chinese live in china. Just noticed the temu situation overseas. Temu also has its app in china, do the same gaming. We do hate it, but most people still addicted to it because of lower price option. That’s the situation. Aliexpress is better and trustable but fail in the advising and promotion games than Temu."
Tried temu once. And that's it. Aliexpress is so much better.
"Unless ur buying expensive stuff Temu seems more convenient, sometimes order ali Express . But returns are a lot more complicated with ALI"
"Considering there’s a government warning to not download temu due to security risks in so many places I’m amazed so many people do. 

I saw a YouTube video that compared the temu app design to a gambling app in terms of how it makes dopamine when you use it. So maybe that’s if."
"The first time I looked at Temu it did that spinny wheel bullshit for the entrance deal, or maybe it does that all of the time idk.  Nothing that looks that jank can be good."
"I’ve used both and prefer Temu because the products are delivered in a week to 10 days.  If you have issues with an order or a  product is damaged you get one opportunity for each order  to have it refunded without having to return the product if it’s from Temu.  They also have local warehouses ( where you can get your items even quicker if your order is coming from one of them) so not sure how returns for those work.  Their customer service is great.  The ads and games are gimmicky but I, as well as others have gotten free products for playing them.

My main reason for shopping with Temu over Ali  though is how quickly I can receive my items and the fact that they will adjust the price (in the form of  Temu credits) if the price of the item you purchase drops.  If it drops 20 times  within 30 days, you will get 20 price adjustment credits that make up the difference in the price you paid and the lower price it is now.

I found Temu about 2 months after they first launched and have been shopping there ever since.  When I first started… they didn’t even have a minimum  price limit .  My first order was $6 just to see if they were legit and I would actually get my items because i couldn’t believe the prices were so cheap. and back then, if you put items in your cart but didn’t check out, they would send a $5.00 off coupon to encourage you to check out.  Those days are long gone as now they’ve gone from $10 to a $20 minimum order and now it’s $18  but still worth it to me. 

 I also like that while you can’t choose your delivery company… You can have them black listed so they won’t ship through them.   One company delivered my package.. Took 2 photos, one highlighting the package  and another just focusing on my address.  Want to get the package once i saw it was delivered an HD the fete was no package.  My kid happened to come home shine the guy was still there but didn’t know it was the delivery guy.  I’m in the phone with Temu and about 30 minutes later the survey rings and i look out the window and it’s the truck my kid saw.  For whatever reason, they brought it back but where gone by the time i got downstairs to get it.  Had them blacklisted the same day.

Only had one scam incident.  Ordered a bookcase and was sent the Fed ex tracking info. Got the delivered notification and the photo proof was a house other than mine.  Fedex said my address wasn’t the one listed as the recipient address. Sent to the “wrong” address…  this seller had no reviews but had some sales but as the reviews started coming in.. They all had the same issue as mine… sent to the wrong address.  Fedex was no help but Temu promptly refunded my money and gave me an extra $10 in credits for the trouble."
I’m with you! I loooooove AliExpress but have bought the odd thing here and there from Temu too. Temu is cheaper and I’m finding less and less free shipping offered on AliExpress.
"Here in Croatia people use it because it's ""translated"" in Croatian language. Same as Wish. Aliexpress isn't translated."
They market it more towards westerners
"I just used temu once to try it, but never again. It is the worse experience, while on AliExpress i never had big problems"
Temu sends my orders faster than ali express
I miss how wish was a decade ago. I used to order trinkets daily lol
"Temu sell AU power connectors, where AliExpress, sell US/EU as standard..

And I find it easier, deliver 1 package, where AE deluvers many smaller bags...

Choice... i still use both, as they sometime don't sell competing products.."
"Have used both.
Ali express has more options.

Seems cheaper but then realised temu includes the GST my government wants in the price, where as aliexpress adds it at checkout,  so I'd have to actually compare those final prices to make a comparison.

Ordered some cologne from temu as aliexpress choice wouldn't ship it and didn't want to risk it from other sellers as I think I'd get a quick refund from temu if it isn't allowed in, although aliexpress hasnt shafted me on refunds before,  I just made the call to temu them.

Also it was cheaper on temu through some sale deal at the time.

Also their tracking seems better somehow?
Aliexpress tracking has been off lately."
"I have seen a chain saw buy from temu Tik Tok video , and I think it is not bad."
"Aliexpress in my country has been super problematic. They never deliver the item on time. If they do deliver, its 2 weeks after the estimated delivery date. I chose a Choice seller this time for a product and they never shipped out my product and refused to cancel my order. On top of that, my order details page was frozen so I couldn't even cancel it myself. I did get refunded but after 1.5 months. 

For me, I've always chosen good, reputable stores to order from but I've always had problems. Temu is definitely not as good as Aliexpress in product variety but I'm able to find most things there and they deliver to my house in under a week. Oh yeah, Aliexpress for whatever reason says they'll do doorstep delivery for me but I always end up having to go to the Post office to collect my items and pay more money just to collect the item. Super annoying experience overall."
Temu has a better UI and recommendations (algorithm) is better. Gets people shopping more.
"The quality is better on Ali express. At least this is my experience. On Temu you got a lot miserable cloned stuff, while on Ali express everything was good so far. 
I ordered 5 cases for my iPhone on Temu. 3 of 5 were not usable because the buttons were not working. Ok they give you fast refund but I buy because I need thing not because I want to refund it"
"The sizing on clothes is pretty reliable on Temu, Ali is totally hit and miss."
"You've never been to a casino...Temu feels like a casino on steriods. Not even a nice Vegas one, more like a on the boarder Louisiana one.

That appeals to some people."
Because in my case aliexpress has the worst customer service I've ever had to deal . On one occasion I had a parcel so called delivered yet I never received it and the pictures courier sent was of a totally different house yet aliexpress never replied to my dispute and on another occasion was spoke to so rudely
"As long as you use don’t use the app it’s fine… cheaper then AliExpress and a lot faster for delivery.
I personally use a vpn or at the very least the Brave browser to stop pop ups but stopped using AliExpress as things just took too long to arrive and many times the products were either broken and the refund process is also crappy too!"
"I went on temu once and was so overstimulated, it feels like those sketchy sites that pop up when trying to pirate movies lol. hated the experience"
"Temu generally sells lower value products and items I've found (Alibaba is the better AliExpress in this regard). Shipping is similar if not the same as AliExpress, and AliExpress is much more trustworthy and not a tracking nightmare, as well as having stuff I need or want whereas temu does not. I would avoid temu like the plague"
"Traditionally,  you check temu, then check ali express for the same item.  Also on temu you can request refunds and sometimes it's without returning the item.  Plus offers of 10 quid off 20, 15 off 40. Daily you'll get an offer to slash an item you want to half or a third of its' starter price.  Stuff you actually want if its in your basket already.  Ali express is a little more convoluted than temu but worth it if the price is right."
"Out of 3 different datapoints on each - Temu has delivered faster in all instances in addition to pricing seeming more transparent. Having said that, Aliexpress has a better selection of products."
"No idea, I've downloaded the app a couple of times and it's always the same. They make you click on a bunch of game like pop ups and say you just won a bunch of coupons or free items IF you buy x amount from their page.

But none of that shit is the thing I was trying to buy, the stuff they give you is usually really cheap or very low discount coupons, and the items you have to buy to get the prices are higher value items that are way overpriced compared to AE (I've checked multiple times). 

The only thing I can give them is they seem to offer free shipping on everything, which is nice if you want to get a large or heavy item."

"I’ve ordered many times from Temu with no issues. The one time I needed to return something, it was smooth and easy.

On the other hand, the very first time I ordered from Ali, the Halloween costume I got for my kid did not match its size description, and when I tried to return it, I discovered the return page is broken—it won’t allow me to upload pictures but also won’t accept the return without pictures. Customer service passed me off to a higher team, who said I’d have to open a dispute with the seller. So much for “buyer protection” and “free returns”! There goes $40 down the drain and I need to find another Halloween costume! I will NEVER order from Ali again."
"Temu has less fraudulent multiple listings. Those articles with a low price, that when you click you see that the listed price is for the case, or other crap, and the real article is more expensive."
"it's both the same 

\* no proper search  
\* no proper sort by price, including cost of delivery  
\* no proper choice  
\* no ""visited link"" support

Ali has more offers. Both have poor support. So both are more a kind of lottery instead of reliable systems for actual shopping. Both don't care about sellers who try to trick you."
"Let's be real, even though the AliExpress app has more quality, Temu's return policy is far better than AliExpress."
"I've used Temu more than Aliexpress in recent years. Reasons being:

* Price point roughly the same, maybe a few cents higher.
* Free shipping over $35 (Same as Amazon)
* Actual tracking at each check point
* Shipping within 1-2 weeks, closer to 1 week
* Easy refund and returns, credit if item arrives late.
* I haven't had to intensely scrutiny each storefront to judge their reputation before ordering
* My item is guaranteed to arrive, and I won't be gambling and possibly losing money.

About info getting stolen, don't use the mobile app, and don't let the webpage store your CC info.

That being said, I still go on Aliexpress to compare and look for alternates. I find Aliexpress has a lot more selection, but also a lot more RNG 😂 and a lot less protection. And of course, shipping to my country takes minimum one month. It really depends on what you want to buy, how soon you need it, price point and gambling on the store."
"I’m in Nz, and hands down its delivery time. 6-7 days not 30 days"
"I like aliexpress better because they dont have such high minimum purchase for free shipping as Temu. Temu deliver in 2 weeks but some ali store is close to that. some Temu promotions was like pick item from a list with inflated price, i will end up buying lot more things I dont need than just place order for that single item from ali when they are on sale. back in beginning of 2023 temu price is really low. fast forward to 2024, price cant really beat aliexpress plus aliexpress is free shipping with really min purchase. I am talking about $0.75 canadian dollar or even crazy some item delivered at $0.04"
"I've heard about people getting their credit card info stolen on Temu. That's a big no no for me. Plus, I've been shopping on AliExpress since 2019 and the only item I had problems with, was a sewing ruler that came bent on the mail, so I don't think that's AE's fault. I try to choose items from Choice or just reputable stores and no problems so far."
Well its also about having both if you watch prices fluctuate and sometimes the prices are better on the other but overall ali x is better.
I thought of taking one of those initial offers and nothing else.
"50% coupon in the beginning was amazing, bought lot of small stuffs. These days I just use it whenever there is another 20%+ cashback.

  
Temus search is unusable, I use image search to find stuffs.."
"I went to AliExpress the day I learned that I could get almost everything from Amazon cheaper since there are too many dropshippers over there so I said fuck it. Also Amazon prime is just ass it’s not really 2 day shipping most of the time and paying that sucks 

And i don’t like temu looks shady from the get go"
"I've switched a lot of smaller purchases over to Temu in the last year.  I still use Ali more for electronics selection that aren't on Temu.  Here are some of the pluses for me:

- Shipping is quicker than even choice shipping on ali is (this can vary by location but where I'm at in Canada, it's consistently quicker).  
- Hassle free price adjustments.  Check your orders click price adjustment and if it's selling for less it will credit your account right away.  
- Search filters actually work.  On Ali every time I go sort by price, etc.. items just disappear from the search, on Temu never have this problem.  
- Easy returns so far.  Only have had to return 2 things so far, both times the Temu system just automatically offered me credit and keep the item.  Didn't have to send a message to the seller and hassle with them like I do on Ali.  
- I get offered good promotions consistently.  The Temu coupon bundles are garbage, but I get offered credit back on purchases often.  Like this week I spent 40$ and got back 30$ in credit in my account (however they do game-ify this crap and make you log in every day to claim the credit split over the course of 7 days which is a bit annoying).

Both have mini games and whatnot to earn discounts, Temu shoves them down your throat while Ali seems to just let you discover them yourself which is a plus for Ali.  I feel both have pros and cons, most stuff you can get on Temu you can get for the same or cheaper on Ali and there's more selection of stuff on Ali.  But with this there's sometimes hoops you have to jump through to find them or when you have problems that are just a much more simplified experience on Temu."
"Temu are spending a *lot* of money to gain market share/customers, both via advertising/marketing and by discounting products heavily, in many cases very close to if not actually below cost.

Also, kind of like with Wish of yore, they seem to be happy to look the other way vis-a-vis some very dubious products, be they grey-market products, ""reps"", or things people really just oughtn't be selling (like pre-drilled ""solvent traps"")."
"I use both.  Ali has more products.  But have you seen Temu’s promos?  You get a lot of stuff for free and sometimes, they’ll even give you back credit on your whole order essentially making the whole order for free.  They had Rakuten 12% cashback, price adjustment for 30 days after order date.  And if the order is late, they give you $5. So if your order is less than $5, and it is late, you even make money back.  Also Cash App ran a promo of 15% off the order amount if you use it to pay for your order.  All of these stack on each other.

Best promo I got from Ali was $8 off $70."
"The prices are better on AliExpress, BUT at least for me shipping and delivery has been way more consistent with temu, I’ve had an easier time finding what I was looking for ( excepting pc parts) and tracking was better. I’ll generally check both sites before ordering"
"Temu has been very quick on shipping. aliexpress could take a month depending on the item. Ali express is way better for tech if you know what to look for, Temu is more for diy crafts, novelty gifts and cheap clothing for costumes. I did find the case for my PC for half off, but it was a first time user deal. I don't like how they spam my emails, a lesser person could spend a hundred dollars a week if they get constantly teased with pseudo deals. But there is a charm in finding something random and new. I do wear some of their stuff as a novelty costumes. Temu has its purpose."
"The only advantage to Temu is all your stuff comes in one package. This is not always the case with Aliexpress. Also returning stuff is easier. They heavily advertise through influencers. Pretty much what Wish did back in the day. We no longer hear about Wish. Do we?

I buy a lot from Aliexpress and it has a lot more variety, especially for the items I am interested in. I shopped from Temu but I was quite annoyed. They say they are giving you $100-200 but in reality you only get several small coupons that you can use on orders over certain amounts. Also you have to buy certain stuff that you probably don't need in order to get the gifts they claim to give you. No thanks."
"I've only purchased on Temu once, but after experiencing the impossible *game* spiraling, I deleted my account. It was pretty good for that first purchase tho, as I managed to get somewhere around 17 items for like 20 dollars? And none of them were clothes, which I think is Temu's selling point, but rather useful things like 4 of those flimsy pvc shelves, an assortment of cheap tools, and some other random items. The main con out of that experience is that I had to fill my cart before the first-time buyer discount expired (with a set timer that began counting down the moment I logged in) to get the lowest price possible, and that was quite unnecessarily stressful. 

So, after that, I just told my acquaintances to jot down the urls of the items they wanted BEFORE creating an account so that they could stock their carts with leisure and take full advantage of that first discount, which is irrefutably pretty awesome (if it's still around). 

Ali is much more convenient for me in every regard. Despite being a mess sometimes, I can easily sort through what I want, and it feels like a winnable game, unlike Temu, once you know how and where and when to hunt and stack discounts. Besides, a lot of my favorited items have been getting that sweet Choice treatment lately, which makes the waiting experience much more swift, although I also kinda like receiving the occasional forgotten surprise gift from past-me."
"Just hype, I think it will go through the same fate as Shopee"
Cuz they had a super bowl ad
"Hm, never seen anybody obsessing about Temu."
Temu has much faster shipping to Australia so lately I’ve actually been using Temu more than Aliexpress
"If you know how to time it to get credit back, it's almost giving you stuff for free."
"Temu is dangerous shit. I am happy with Aliexpress, that still feels civilised and things are pretty good with basic research of what to expect."
I use both so I have had no problem whatsoever on my cc or even purchases except for one thing I bought a little dresser but they shipped it with different color other than that I’ve had no problem using both
Shipping times lowkey
Temu seems like the new version of Wish to me. Alie and Shein have always yielded consistent results for me.
"For me it’s faster and more secured shipping to EU (max 2 weeks). Aliexpress is good for smaller packets where they can deliver straight to mailbox, also takes up to a month to get package."
"When I saw the temu interface, I thought it was a AliExpress' rip off... Didn't want to try it. "
"My mom uses Temu a lot, but she probably likes all the games and shit.  I don't think I've ever actually ordered anything from Temu, but seeing the stuff my momma got the quality seems similar to Ali.  I've used Ali for years now. I've bought all kinds of different stuff and the only time I had an issue was when I ordered a ring set and it only came with one of the rings.  They refunded me really fast.

Temu has been advertising their asses off. I get a Temu ad before every YouTube video. They had commercials during the Superbowl which is a big thing in the US. I've never seen an AliExpress ad, ever. That has to play a big part in why Temu has gotten so popular.  I bet a lot of people that use Temu have never heard of AliExpress."
"I find it depends on what I'm buying, but I often check both. Electronics are almost exclusively AliExpress, but clothing, kitchen gadgets, some backpacks, those are usually Temu"
"I find Temu ships a little quicker, so I buy from there is I need to quicker. Sometimes I find things on Temu cheaper than Ali too. I float between both"
"I buy a lot of stationery and in many cases it’s cheaper than Aliexpress and shopping times are faster. Temu has less variety than AE but what they do have is pretty decent. The app is a mess but I just x out and ignore the popups.

Edit: There’s no need to judge people based on the app they’re using to buy cheap products from China 🙄. I have multiple Asian shopping apps, they each have their pros and cons."
"It really depends on what you're buying. Temu is good for dollar store items/general goods - things that are useful for everyday situations. Temu doesn't tend to have niche items, which is where AliExpress shines. Temu can also be better than AliExpress for shipping in some countries."
It got advertised on FB. I think it's more western targeted compared to aliexpress.
They have a much more reliable and faster delivery. After waiting 2 months to get a phone case from Ali express (which turned out to be for the wrong model) I am gonna stick with Temu.
"Idk aliexpress web design is weird? Temu is easier to navigate, granted I dont use the apps only desktop versions"

"Gambling where you are ""guaranteed"" to win"
"I hate the coupons that pops up every time, but their refund-service is really great. AliExpress sucks at that point! Bought a lamp on AliExpress and it was really a pain in the ass to get refunded when I, after 36 days received a broken lamp. Seller tried to scam me to close the dispute but finally agreed to pay me for the lamp."
"Because it is often less expensive, even without the coupons (which when you are on the platform is regularly 20-25% or more) and the customer service is better.

Cons, less products in general.  The pop-ups and hurry up! Effect. I am primarily into building bricks/blocks, so my view may be stilted on the pricing. It is less in general, sometimes significantly, even without the coupons."
"It’s cheap as chips tat, and there’s little they worry about regarding their privacy concerns."

"I love love love Temu!  90 day retuns, no questions asked!

I had $54 in returns (some clothes that were too small) that I took as credit.

Later, Temu gave me a $50 ""credit back"" promo for spending $60+ ... 

...my order was $66... subtract my $54 credits... I paid $12 out of pocket *AND* they gave me $50 back in more credit!

That means my entire $66 purchase cost me $16 (factoring in the $4 credits I lost).  For that, I got a cool t-shirt;  a foot massager;  pop-up plugs for my sink;  10 plastic coffins (for my friend's chocolate biz Halloween sales);  a new, um, ""personal massager"" 😁 ;  a refillable metal pod for the Keurig coffee maker;  and some drape-style lights for my Christmas tree... ALL of it for $16 (including taxes, free shipping, etc)!!

And they accept PayPal as a payment method.

And the shipping is pretty quick as well, within a week or two... if the shipping is late, they will credit you $5.

Credits do NOT expire.

And if the price drops within 30 days, they will credit you the difference if you click the ""price adjustment"" link in your order.

And I have 90 days to return any of the items, on THEIR dime (they provide a shipping label... and most of the time, they tell me just to keep the item + give me a refund because it's cheaper for them than paying for my postage to send it back)!

There is no fight for a refund like with AE, after waiting & waiting (and waiting & waiting!) for the AE package to arrive. Ugh! 

I LOVE TEMU!!"
"AliEx is *excellent* when you're looking for specific things, and to not make a beeline for their cheap Choice section immediately, or judge the site based on that. 

It's become a game for me whenever I suspect a clothing website etc is actually dropshipping products from AliEx - the image search has been pretty good in finding discounts too."
Few weeks ago I shopped from both websits. AliExpress cancelled one of my item after shipping. They also send me notifications for each item separately. Temu's order went more smoothly and received faster as well. To me Temu seems better.
"Temu is advertised a lot more than AE, yeah.

Gotta remember that most normies out there, they only buy what's advertised, nothing more, nothing less, anything not advertised is ""fake"" or ""a knockoff"".  
It's a real pain to get family/friends to try new sodas that aren't Coke/Pepsi products, that's for sure. Half the price, real sugar, made locally, nope, not Coke/Pepsi product, not real, they're just some company trying to copy the big dogs.

My phone's battery lasts two weeks with light use, and three days on heavy use, but it's a generic no-name brand.  
The car's dash says my phone's at 15%, passenger asks why I didn't charge it, we're going to \[event\] and they don't want my phone to die there since I'm the driver.  
I say that's still a few days of battery life. They think I'm joking. I'm serious. They ask what brand it is, I say Cubot, they say they've never heard of it and I can practically see their interest flip a switch.  
*Two week battery life? Nah, it's not a REAL phone, who cares?*  
I mean, my phone's cameras suck butt pretty bad, but other than that it's great and I love it."
It’s cheaper and you can get refunds and keep the stuff
"I don't know about Temu, but AliExpress can be extremely risky if you buy certain categories of high-ticket items. I read about tracking-number scams and tried to find a highly rated seller but was still a victim of blatant tracking-number fraud. I ordered an 1ZPresso K-Ultra coffee grinder (@ $200) from the **Comprehensive Store**, which has a 4.9-star store rating and 96.5% positive reviews.The AE dispute process is a joke. It's extremely slow, and AE clearly gives the benefit of the doubt (even when there shouldn't be any doubt) to the seller because it makes them more money. They ask for evidence in the form of an official letter from the carrier (FedEx) stating that your package was delivered to the wrong address, which is unobtainable because the tracking number is associated with a name and address that aren't similar to yours (except for the town). FedEx will tell you or anyone else exactly this over the phone but won't write a letter because the package is not yours! If you ask AE to call FedEx, they will tell you that can't because they're not the intended recipient, but neither are you! Most infuriating online experience I've ever experienced. After waiting a week with no resolution, I disputed it with my credit card company, which **instantly** and **automatically** resolved the dispute in my favor (no investigation or human involved). So clearly Chase has dealt with plenty of AE fraud. And then AE has the gall to ask me to ask Chase to reverse the chargeback (right!) and won't allow me to review the seller unless I do, which only strengthens my conclusion. Even when buyers win AE disputes, AE merely gives ""deduction points"" to the store rather than banning them forever and pressing criminal charges. As long as the percentage of fraudulent transactions is below a certain percentage, stores can significantly pad their profits through fraud without significant repercussions. I looked at the 1-star ratings for every store that listed the K-Ultra, and they all reported the exact fraud I experienced. Stick with cheap Choice items or take your business elsewhere."
I personally like temu better cuz I get free shipping 😭😭
"#I have spent a ridiculous amount of money on each platform.. Here are a couple of different things I've noticed.


1: AliExpress used to be cheaper for almost everything, similar or same product. But lately aliexpress has been raising their prices majorly. For example, the same item that used to cost $1.99 now costs $3.29 on aliexpress. Temu has also raised their prices. Overall aliexpress still has better deals.


2: Temu's customer service and return process is absolutely, 100%, FAR FAR better than AliExpress's. 


3: Temu offers price adjustments, AliExpress does not. 


3: AliExpress has a much wider variety of products. Temu mainly just has cheap/inexpensive electronics, trinkets, gadgets ect. Aliexpress has those, plus more expensive and name brand products. 


4: Temus shipping speed is usually quicker than AliExpress


5: AliExpress has different tax rates for different sellers (you need to check tax during checkout) one order could be 8% tax and the next order could be 30% tax (8% tax is normal for online goods where I live). Temu tax rate is the same with all products. 


Anyways I still use aliexpress much than Temu but each App has their place for certain items and orders."
Temu is way easier to purchase stuff.  After$25 is free shipping.  Ali every seller has different shipping prices and also noticed that prices change when adding to cart.   Ali is only for stuff that I don't find TEMU
"I can only speak for Norwegians, when shopping on Aliexpress there is a gamble if you have to pay tax 2 times, cause Ali apparently cant register tax properly. You pay tax to Ali when buying the stuff, then when package comes to Norway, you get slapped with more tax + a fee, cause you didn't pay tax...  so you pay 50% tax + $10 to $30 in fees. 

On Temu you pay tax once. No gamble."
"Well, some things can be found for a cheaper price on Temu and one feature I noticed, don’t know how often that happens, as I ordered on Temu only one time, is that if the price lowers of an item you bought recently, you can get back the difference in Temu credits. Not ideal, but better than nothing. Never saw, that Ali would offer the same"
They want to feel like a billionaire
"Because Temu goes *hard* on the marketing and psychological tricks, and plenty of people are stupid enough to fall for it.

But while AliExpress is definitely better and has a far larger range of items, I have noticed that Temu occasionally has something you can't seem to get anywhere else, plus they offer Afterpay which is actually useful.

So I have used it twice so far. But I use AliExpress far more."
"Aliexpress, all day erry damn day. Mostly for watches and accessories."
"Using Temu was the worst!  I think I threw away everything I bought there!  Just pure crap!  They sell you some stuff cheap then try to move you to more expensive crap.  Ali Express is WAY better!  Ali Express has actually been way better as far as service, too!  Temu is one big con!"
"Well, in korea every single advertises in Youtube is temu(more than one-third for now it seems like there are some decrements, according to my friend) . I even bought youtube premium due to their clickbaits and exaggerated depictions on their products."
"its very cheap. it has many products that are not available in customers own countries and collects all products in the order from sellers and ships them in a single package. these are why ppl obsessed with temu.

btw it has special discounts and tons of coupons"
"Long time Aliexpress user here. (Got 600+ orders since 2013)

Recently my country limited customs packs from other countries by 5 packs a month. Temu bundles all and sends all it once so it counts as single pack.

Also, sometimes I find stuff on Ali, then log in my account and eventhough I am a ""VIP"" user according to my profile I get signifcant price increase. If I create a new account I can buy from discounted price. Well no thanks.

Mostly the main reasons why I switched to Temu instead of Ali.

I still buy stuff from Ali if I need something absolutely from there or cant find anywhere else."
What i like better is that when i buy multiple things on each platform temu sends them together and i only need to pay for 1 item but ali sends all of the different item in seperate package so i need to pay tax for each package. So for me temu is cheaper. I like the selection better for useless things on temu but for things i need like spare parts for my e scooter i go to ali.
"Sometimes the prices.

I just looked for chinese novels (because I like their covers) and on Temu an official store (I know it from Taobao) sells the book for $7 (same price then on Taobao) already with tax and shipping and on aliexpress you get the same book (other sellers) for $27 including tax + shipping. So yeah $20 cheaper on Temu then on aliexpress. I still didn't buy it on Temu because they send the items without a protection only a plastic bag so the books come with little dents etc. and on Temu you need be careful with your payment. I heard Temu steals credit card infos and do automatic payment collection if you pay with PayPal. Such things I never had with aliexpress. I only looked on Temu on the web version not app."
People seem to also continuously leave off how Temu basically gets their prices together exclusively through child slavery. You really shouldn't even consider them a viable option... 
Ali's search engine on their website is horrible. It's an awful experience 
Ali does have more choice and some stuff that you just can't find on Temu. I don't like some of Ali express's operating policies though and have stopped using them.
Way way faster shipping and much better customer support. But yes I agree that Aliexpress products tend to be higher 'quality'.
"I’ll give them one thing. The 99% off one item is real. I use it to get a $6 lamp for $0.07 and then spend $4 on some random shit to get $12 for the price of $4. 

Their games? Never one though."
"I placed multiple orders with Temu and liked it.  

I bought some accessories from AliExpress years ago and their shipping was about a month from china.  Did they improve it lately so its similar to temu?

I bought a cabinet from AliExpress just 2 weeks ago and the seller played games by give the wrong tracking and some screenshots of ""their conversation"" with amazon, then no further updates.  I had to open a dispute with aliexpress.  I got the refund and the product listing is no longer available.  Thats pretty shady.  Its only the 2nd time I use AliExpress in 3 years and its a scammer?"
"Temu is a lot more agressive with their ads, have u seen any ali express comercials or ads like ever ? I dont remember seeing one but i do remember my youtube being plagued with Temu ads constantly

Ali is like one of those ""if you know, you know"" type apps whilr Temu instead are trying to target the ali newcomers"
Temu shipping is twice faster and trouble free returns are easy
The shipping tracker sucks on AliExpress. I literally have no clue if something is delivered or not. Temu’s tracking on the other hand has been great and no guessing games at all.
"I have so many questions. Why can't I view their goods before downloading the app? Why do I have to spin the wheel? Why are we given only a few minutes to choose something to buy from their limited offerings? The more gimmicks there are, the more phishy it seems. I'm supposed to believe they're giving me hundreds of dollars in coupons? I don't need anything free. Just let me view the catalog and give me time to compare items before making a decision. "
"Temu made my mom a zombie, I try to talk to her when she’s playing the “games” for free stuff and I will never get a response no matter how hard I try. 

She spends all of her money on it and is totally hooked on it despite getting scammed multiple times from clothing to shoes and a chair she thought she was getting.

There is something about this app that makes it so addictive could be the extremely low prices for some garbage or the constant free things they throw at your face."

"I think the pro with Temu is that they ship everything you've ordered in one unique package, and the shipping is free. While with Aliexpress they ship everything individually and you have to pay the shipping for each item (either while you purchase it, or when it arrives).

And also, Temu is faster in the arrival of the order!"

Temu is cheaper😂😂
Because it's great. I'm tired of people hating on Temu when it's the only place I can buy hamster supplies or any other miscellaneous things for very cheap and for free delivery in like 10 days. They offered me $5 back if it took longer than 10 days. Temu is way better than Amazon.
Aliexpress was annoying to me because I want to pay by PayPal and so would put an order together and then some can and some can't do then would have to look and try to find again and it was just frustrating in that way. Or you see something but then it says 50 minimum order or your shipping option is not available.
"Here’s the deal.. Temu has awesome prices and for many things, the quality is on point. I’ve bought three pairs of women’s bootcut stretchy jeans for under $13 after tax each with free shipping, that would undoubtedly cost $40 each at Target. lol. Haha! And the quality is THERE. So yeah I love it. And the fact that they accept PayPal seals the deal for me since PayPal protects customers from the scandalous Facebook fly by night Chinese companies. Temu is legit cheap deals. "

"I used AliExpress until I got Temu 


I like Ali cause you can actually search for what you want if it's a brand, like pokemon, where with temu, if you do you might get only get a few items since they don't put the brand in the items so you might find something if you search ""cute yellow monster""


Things have changed since I've used it, but Ali used to take months to deliver, recently it was just a couple of weeks.and Temu usually shows up within 2 weeks and they will give you $5 automatically if it's late.


I think Ali is more expensive in comparison. The store discount vouchers aren't very good, I don't think I've ever been able to use one.


Temu vouchers can be hit or miss, there's some lousy automatic pop ups ""you've earned a big coupon! Spend $50 to get 50c off!"" But they also have good ones like spend $100 get $40 back. 


My usual purchases are D&D dice. When I first started getting them, I got a gift for all the players from Ali. 1 was missing a dice. 1 you couldn't tell what the item inside was (skull) 1 the numbers were painted poorly on the main dice so you couldn't read it, and trying to get a refund it like pulling teeth. They offered me 50c for the missing dice. They wouldn't send me the one missing, they weren't asking for it back and resending so that took a few days for them to give me maybe $8. What is 50c gonna do for me if I had to re buy a $20 set? Nothing


Haven't had to do a temu refund yet so I can't judge on that. I have seen mixed reviews from people on it.


Shipping - temu screwed around until it had enough people so now it's a $40 minimum (Australia) Ali is cheaper but it's got a shipping  per item unless you do the special choice items that is free shipping if you spend over $15? Been a while, so might be a bit wrong with the choice promotion 


Prices seem to fluctuate on temu, but I just keep it in my cart until I think it's a good price. I have recently found that if the item goes cheaper within a month of purchase you can also get the difference credited back automatically if you request it


Overall I prefer temu, it is doing some scummy scammy stuff lately though, like pick a free item and pay for 7 ""half price"" (they aren't) but if the ones you're paying for are too low in comparison to the free item it's ""suddenly out of stock"" I get it, they aren't going to let you get a $45 item by spending $8.


Or saying this item is $10 and you think oh that's a good price drop, then you see the tiny fine print ""with your credit applied"" they nearly got me.




I will keep both apps, Ali express might get an occasional look through, but temu will be a daily playthrough with the searches and games for the freebies (which stitched me up last time I won but that's a whole other thing)"
this is 100% why (i made this with the help of ai superpowers): [https://soundcloud.com/user-719517160-777151965/sets/temu-tidings-a-quirky-christmas-collection?si=ff592e6658a748b1a8f217c8b095c165&utm\_source=clipboard&utm\_medium=text&utm\_campaign=social\_sharing](https://soundcloud.com/user-719517160-777151965/sets/temu-tidings-a-quirky-christmas-collection?si=ff592e6658a748b1a8f217c8b095c165&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)
Got my second order today of temu and 5 minutes after I opened it I deleted every trace of temu off my phone .and i will never be back nere it how the get away with this crap is unbelievable.a bag full of rubbish not like I thought I had ordered in any way . lesson learned and it did not cost me that much .but now I know temu is the worst place to shop ever.
"Ads, Temu is spamming ads left and right, not sure if I'm being targeted due to age/sex/location/hrowserhistory or what but I can't go anywhere without seeing ads for temu, I assume this is the same for others cuz themu was just there all of a sudden.

Also, as others have mentioned, I think temu shipped faster, seems like it as Ali have become a bit better at least after temu started."
"I put in 2 order one on Dec 4th and the other on Dec 7th the ones ordered on the 7th have arrived.  The one ordered on the 4th still waiting on. Going to be here Dec 11 -20 still no package asked for a refund we'll I can't have the refund until Dec 27 - Jan 1 so no matter what I did still have to wait.
  Thank you temu you have wrecked our Christmas.


   P s.   Not the first problem with temu"
"I avoid buying things straight up on Temu or any of the gambling things but Temu often offers better deals and promotions, like I been offered free items on aliexpress once with a purchase with Temu, I consistently get these offers where spend 45$ get 4 free items, I recently moved from a shared apartment with 16 sockets 4 outlets of 4 sockets each  to plug into in my 80 square foot bedroom into a studio apartment with a total and had lots of items such as extension  into a studio with 4 outlets with only 2 sockets each , all horribly placed behind where furniture naturally goes, these deals have gotten me free extension cords, kitchen equipment, window shades, clothing, and more, all while I purchase furniture that would have been same price on aliexpress."
"O Aliexpress ta entregando por duas transportadoras horríveis, CAINIAO e ANJUNEXPRESS. A Anjun express é literalmente criminosa. A Temu pelo menos entrega pelos correios. Recomendo dar uma olhada na pagina da ANJUN no instagram."
"(Canadian) I've gotten over $5000 of free stuff in the last like 20 months while spending maybe $500, they have a buy 90$ and get 100 in credit(you spend $45 twice getting 50 twice) did that over and over again recycling credit for more credit, that plus them being late multiple times and their customer service bot being refund happy(it literally refunds me whole orders with me just mentioning the package is late) has me $250 positive in credit I haven't spent real money since july"
Search my temu code in temu search bar for one free gift only 69150137
No Temu is faster. Ali when I order the product 3$ abd shipping 5. And it takes 5 to 8 weeks to sweden. Temu just buy for 30 free shipping and get it 3 to 4 weeks. But ali have lot more stuff
Temu have too much Crappy junk.
Temu is only better in free shipping everything else ali solos
"It’s just hype, and most people are trend followers"
People are paid to talk about it. That's all it is
"ali express sucks, had to find out the hard way, so will you eventually"
They’re both shit
"People like casino will sure like Temu. Little they know that at the very end on checkout with all the coupons, freebies and bonus game is barely any difference than buying from AliExpress.

Is really funny with the 90% discount but end up more expensive than AliExpress for some items."
"Simple answer: Agressive marketing from Temu. 

Thoughts: Temu is kind of the Wish of today with one objective: trying to get mr & ms everyone buying on it, with more money involved in marketing than Wish in the past. Aliexpress was (and is still a little) kind of hidden and used more by people that look for alternatives. I think Temu going to finish the same as Wish (and it use the exact same methods for getting the mass with roulette etc...) once the honey moon is over. Still a good platform for stupid things (like getting 5 mario shrooms plush for 10€, which is kind of nice) at 15€/$ or less, while Aliexpress will keep the users for more expensive things."
Let’s keep the Temu’s off of Ali please 🙂‍↕️🤫
"Because they want to shop like a billionaire, even if they only have $26.43 in their bank account."
Just don't buy from temu they're been scamming their suppliers. And priced on there is insane. AliExpress way cheaper
Because your average consumer is stupid and will really fall for these tactics
"Is overrated, totally, just because of tik tok"
Aliexpress is way more better and reliable compare to temu been long time user of aliexpress and started using temu too some time ago trust me temu is useless
I just bought a hat from aliexpress and the next day I call from my bank stating a payment for $50 was whisper was declined and someone stole my debit card Info. So yea I rather use Temu
"People are dumb nowadays, they want stupid non sense things, that's all."
It's a tacky app for tacky people.
People like the stupid game shit on it. I am not kidding that people will install it for the lame games.
"Temu has always been eye-sore. But that whole gacha mechanic on a shopping website  is just so insane, and tacky."
Correct
Someone wanted to create their aliexpress but boosting the gambling part
AliExpress has the same things though.
"Dependingo on what you're buying sometimes it's worth it. I use both but have been using temu more for cheaper item, since I get a whole lot of ""choose 2 items free"" offers and then it requires me to make a purchase but it's fairly easy to find discount items at good price within the choice list provided by them. Bigger purchases, eletronics, clothes and apparel, temu sucks and I don't trust them. But I've been buying crafts supplies at good prices with the temu ""games"""
That’s how I felt too. Like stepping into a casino hell when you open the app. It felt incredibly addicting.
"I ordered from temu once, immediately went back to aliexpress as the prices are just better there."
That's on AliExpress too
"Addicted to those? No way! They are so annoying. I tried them a few times trying to seeing what ""deals"" i may get.  I always just wait a little and close them.  Besides that temu has fast shipping (compared to AliExpress) and good customer service.

I"
I tried the mini games got a few free things but then they started offering me $50 credit for spending less than $50 so I've gotten a couple thousand dollars worth from that and I haven't spent any money since the original $100 in july (you can do it twice at a time) and im up like $250 in credit
Because they sort by price and pick the cheapest without looking at anything else.
"I've bought 100s maybe 1000s of items so far. Never had a full on scam. I've had the wrong items sent or a sorting mistake and got refunded right away. Even those times the wrong item was sent it was actually worth more than what I wanted and oddly enough was something I could use anyways. 🤣

I think most people getting ""scammed"" are not following the FAQ, and checking reviews, along with not using some common sense.

There is always a chance you'll get duped but if you're getting duped most of the time that becomes a YOU problem more so than anything. Millions of people buy off that platform without come here in droves to complain."
I never buy anything with no ratings
"They even have browser addons to make it easy and streamline experience. It would give you a warning if the seller is new or has bad reputation and you can check price history if discounts are real. I've been ordering for probably about 10 years at this point, including smartphones, car parts, some electronical components, as well clothing and householding crap. I literally never had issues, and whenever I did I got a full refund promptly."
"It's been like that since marketplaces exist... People will choose the cheapest stuff without any research then get scammed.
But, it shouldn't be that easy for scammers to act on those platforms though."
"I've bought some sketchy stuff like GPU from a seller with handful reviews and I've never been scammed.   
When Ali is handling hundreds of thousands sales daily, some products will be broken, some will get lost in shipping, some may even be an intentional scam. It may seem like a number of mistakes is high but that's just because angry customers are more likely to create reddit posts."
"When it comes to Beyblades (a kind of turbo top that's used for a sumo wrestling type game) I really like buying from a seller called SoLong4u
They never let me down. Quality,  and trustworthy arrivals!"
Same! I love AliExpress!
"It's the same for Amazon. If you buy something with no reviews you're basically screwed. 


Ive purchased maybe 8 items in the last 2 years from Amazon that all ended up being absolute crap or not even remotely close to the photographs of the listing. I haven't ordered much from Amazon in the last while because they stopped allowing my reviews to be posted on those scam products. 


I'm an idiot for not catching on or paying more attention for reviews. Ali has been great, and carries all the same Amazon stuff but for cheaper. Ive been following the reviews there and it's worked out great."
What the fuck is your username lmao
"I ordered a cabinet 2 weeks ago coz the seller was the only one.  I searched it based on the wayfair (where i found it) description and aliexpress and amazon also popped up, but AliExpress was slightly cheaper and it said ships locally.  Received fake tracking and got a refund with aliexpress.  How do people/scammers think they could get away with the buyer protection policies from aliexpress or even paypal?"
"Exactly lol, AliExpress is fine if you know what to look for - which all mostly requires common sense.

I’ve replaced my amazon subscription with AE now"
"Longest shipping time i had on ali was 3.5 months.
Longest shipping time i had on Temu was 3 weeks"
"Do you mind if I ask what you buy on Temu?
Everytime I'm looking for something Temu just isn't selling that."
I'm from Europe so those things may be better for US.
"Totally agree. I buy when I get the 2 items free offer a lot. I’ve found with the games, fishland and farmland do take awhile, but you absolutely will get your 3 totally free items when you complete each. I don’t do the “5 free gifts” games because they never work out for me. I did coffeetree but with that one you have to make a purchase for your ”earned” free gift and it is usually a low cost gift so I don’t bother.

Ive been happy with 98% of items purchased, and the few I wasn’t were refunded no problem with free return shipping. I also love that if the price drops within 30 days of purchase you get a credit for the difference. And if it takes more than 2 weeks for order to arrive they automatically give you a $5 credit.

plus I’ve found the clothing is sized correctly. You don’t have to guess and size up 2-3 sizes like wish or SHEIN."
Do they have lotsa really free stuff and what is the best gacha casino free discounts you did get? I’ve got at most 58$ free money in ali in soccer event (most one was 8$ by betting against Ukraine) and spent to buy big batteries. I live in Ukraine and my median salary is 150$/month so those bonuses are great deal (still better situation than of most men here that have to work unofficially or are thrown to war). I used to play gacha kusoge anyways so will gladly accept temu’s freebies. Still need to buy solar panels.
LOLOL!
"I started using 'em when many items were loss-leaders to attract customers. I still buy quirky t-shirts from them sometimes, when they're on sale; better quality than Old Navy at half the price.

I use the website, not the app, and it's completely devoid of any minigame shenanigans.

The automatic ""whoops, your stuff got held up in customs, here's $5"" is kind of nice."
"My only complaint with AE was that shipping is slow and now they have fixed it so it's great now.  
Would be even better if they added tax to the prices so you know exactly how much you will pay."
"Same for me in Sweden, and all the order comes together compared to how Ali can be"
eu region?
Jeez 5-8 WEEKS? Aliexpress takes about a month for me if it’s regular shipping.  If I go with Choice suppliers then it’s always 7 days or less 😊
Wich country?
"AliExpress is part of the Alibaba group isn't it, and Alibaba has some pretty funny products. Like a chip making factory line, or a full on tunnel bore"
"Not from my experience. Perhaps it's because I'm a ""frequent"" shopper on AE but I have gotten almost all of the refunds I requested since I only request if the product didn't match. Maybe it depends on the reason you request for a refund? Honestly it might just be that if you're a ""frequent customer"" they're more likely to side with you than the seller. Just my guess"
"AliExpress does refunds perfectly fine for me, they step in for every issue I've opened and given me a full refund"
You can remove that limit. Chat with their support bot and tell it to remove the limit. It will be removed permanently.
Exactly what I was going to say.
Temu is the Aliexpress version of Aliexpress.
"Tbh a government warning is only there for the chinese fear mongering. Same with tiktok. Yes they both collect as much info as they can from you but the point here being ALL companies do that. Literally the only reason theyre saying all the stuff is ""temu popular, its chinese, it is bad"""
"The government warning part I get it, their parent company was punished for treating customer data inappropriately in China in the past ,but these days it's no different on any platforms. yes, they try to extract as much infromation as possible and it even tracks WiFi location data without ever asking you. pretty creepy, but guess what, google and facebook, insta do more than that.  
yes it's bad, but is it national threat? no. commercial data collection, just notrmal stuff.

and yes, for the latter part it's very correct, Temu is combimation of social media, with game-ified gambling and shopping on top. the app is addictive to some people because it creates anticipation that you might get huge discount, and that's how they hook people. becuase dopamine is not connected to the reward but the anticipation of it, to drive action towards the reward. and that's what social media apps and gamling both do."
"They’re annoying but legit. I had a “get six free items” promo pop up once. I had to get I think four new users to sign up for the app (not buy anything themselves, just get the app), and then picked my free items. I was suspicious the whole time but two weeks later all my free swag arrived. It was awesome."
"What specifically do u look for? Cuz if its like.. Bike inner tires or dc to dc converters obviously temu doesnt have it. They market and sell to ""the average joe and jess"" not to ""the programmer who needs a new ESP32"""
"I heard about people having their CC info stolen from Temu, so I link my CC to PayPal, and pay Temu that way.  Not only does PayPal disperse the payment to Temu from my CC (protecting my CC # from being seen by Temu at all), but it also gives me 6 full months to file a dispute if I ever have a  problem with Temu."
"Tbh just using paypal fixes the issue, i dont even buy from places i cant use klarna/paypal. And from what i know those are rumors or highly overexxagerated coincidences"
Its the other way for me. Ali is half the price from the amazon. I dont Like temu because of the Data grabbing they do.
Same for me on temu xD
"Accept my invite & Get 4 freebies! Download Temu and search my code to accept my invitation: 
27673516"
"I have a hamster, Temu had a sand bath, mushroom bottle holder and a mushroom bowl that I wanted for cheaper, it came in 9 days!"
When did the order on 7th arrive?
1 on Dec 11 and one on 14
same stuff as AE & Amazon
i also don’t really care for temu
temu is way worse about selling your info than ali is 😭
I agree. Sadly I’ve noticed aliexpress has slowly starting adopting some of these gimmicks and I’m not a fan!
It works. That is all that matters.
"Temu was founded by former [Wish.com](http://Wish.com) execs- I think that's why they have the cheesy gambling slant, bc Wish apparently did that too."
"There is no gambling. Read the rules. You will get the top discount, 100% of the time. The experience is just for show.

Also, those ""cash back"" coupons you get have minimum spend required."
"I actually like Temu for bigger items to, as they also have a win credit promotion, where you spend around 200$ and win 100-140$ credit back  depending on the week, with my Temu circle I get extra 23$ cash back and roll it into the next time it’s offered, used this  to buy allot of my furniture. It’s the same items as aliexpress"
"They are like AE in that they have multiple sellers who sell the same item at various price points.  I saw a mason jar sealer for $24 by one seller, and then the next day I saw the same item being sold by another seller for $15.  You just have to get the name of the item, do a search for it, and then use the filters to sort the price from lowest to highest.

And if the price drops within 30 days, they will credit you the difference if you click the link in your order."
"I must be really lucky. Ordered some RC cars, 3D printing steel sheets and filament, hygrometer, building blocks, USB-LEDs... 

None of them was a scam.  
I always try to find the cheapest shops and have not checked their names."
"it's the exact same stuff as amazon these days. I moved to a bigger apartment recently, and i'm not well off, so i look for deals a lot, and let me tell you: it's literally the same shit. Let's say you're looking for, i don't know, a chair. You could buy it off amazon, or aliexpress. It's gonna be the same chair, from the same factory, with the only difference being that ali buys it from the factory in china and ships it straight to you, while amazon buys it from the factory in china, ships it to the amazin warehouse, then ships it to you. The actual items are the exact same stuff, you just need to actually use your eyeballs and do some research. I've seen the exact same items on ali, temu, amazon, and local online stores. I've ordered things from ali and they've arrived within 2 days from a local warehouse, and ordered things from amazon that take 10 days because they are coming from china anyways.

You really, really need to check the reviews. Not just the item itself, but the *seller*. If a seller has dozens of reviews with people saying they received the wrong item, or were one screw short, or had manufacturing errors, don't buy from them. When something has only 3 reviews and it's 5 stars, don't buy from them (the reviews are fake/bots/incentivized with points). Buy from folks with high numbers of reviews, with reviews that are actually written about the item, and with many reviews on the seller saying they provide good service.

The main advantage of buying local/amazon will be speed of delivery and ability to track the package. The main advantage of temu/ali/et al is going to be that certain knock off products will be available that aren't on something like amazon, and that you can often buy something much cheaper by just getting it from the factory itself."
"Yeah, just engage your brain for 2 seconds before ordering the 32€ Laptop from the 0 Review seller and you will be fine.

Had 100s of orders and never been scammed. Sure sometimes the size is not like I thought when seeing the pictures or the quality is really Bad, but in extreme cases you easily get your money back."
"I think this is a big factor. People make mistakes. Things get sorted wrong, lost in transit, etc, and some folks will immediately jump to ""the evil chinese scammed me"" lmao"
Million of people buy from AE and they don't need to go online post that they don't have complains.
Can you type those add-ons names here
I didn't know there were addons but I'll make sure to use them in the future. Thanks!
Only buy name brand items on Amazon and you'll be okay.
"That's a big issue with Amazon. If you have an honest but negative review, chances are they will reject your review.

IMHO Amazon are amongst the biggest scammers out there."
"Yes, this, and temu is sending me more often the updates about my package, i also ordered something i didn't want accidentally on temu, i noticed that the next day and they resolved and refunded me without any problems, while i heard on aliexpress it can be tricky because it depends on the seller, some people get refunded and some do not, so i guess i see temu as safer option in many ways"
"Clothes, activewear, certain types of jewellery, phone accessories, homewear"
"Temu is a wonderful place for someone in the USA to buy many things for a lot less. For example, RGB USB C phone charger 1m long in my country is $5.00 or more. On Temu the exact same thing is $1.28. USA businesses like to resell stuff made in China for a much higher price. As a matter of fact, I bought a purse as a present for someone's birthday party. It was the exact same one that was being sold by Victoria's Secret for $80, but I got it on Temu before Victoria's Secret got a chance to put their logo on it for less than $15. And she loved it!"
I'm from Europe and get those things as well so it's better.
Temu can keep the prices so low because they strong arms their sellers to sell their products at a loss. You get what you pay for..... Don't be surprised stuff from Temu and even Ali express and Wish don't last very long.
We don't want the crap no one can sell!
What’s funny?
"The problem with chinese apps is it is not regulated by laws, they can basicly do anything and face no repercutions, cause china is a one party state."
"I wouldn't be willing to get anybody to sign up, that's the 2nd place I would stop.  That's just my personality type though I suppose, if it worked out for you that's awesome!  It does sound like a good introductory deal!"
[removed]
My mom buys from temu constantly and she has to get new card ever few months cause of it... lol
Got text today saying it's in Grand rapids I don't live in GR so at least a couple more days for my Dec 4th  order to arrive 
But aliexpress does have better stuff overall. Temu stuff is very hit and miss
Not saying u aint wrong but do u have proof? Ive literally only seen like 2 stories which ended up being hoaxes about stolen cc details and the news were making them into mountains when in reality they were anthills.
Just telling yall my first experience. It just happened on Monday idk why anyone is mad at my experience. Any foreign site can do it. It just never happened when I used Temu
"Shopping (especially online) is already exhausting itself. The whole *spin the wheel, maybe get a good deal* is enough for me to not be interested."
Is it? But Temu is owned by PDD of china which is way bigger than wish.  Never ordered from wish for some reason.
"That shit is enough to make me not want to use it

If they insist on the charade, they need to speed it up"
"This, also the Search Similar option (it appears when you click into the product images, and it appears as a button above the image) gives you faster matches and price comparisons."
"Yeah I have also bought a lot of random shit on Ali that is way cheaper there than on Amazon, for example, specific brands for aquarium leds, in that case the difference was around 50 usd so I actually prefered to wait a week and a half than pay 50 usd for immediate delivery. I was doubtful at the beginning but everything arrived on time and the product worked nicely so I was happy with the purchase"
"Ive been ""scammed"" some times when just buying the cheapest stuff, but immediately got my money back. (Like glass protectors that werent glass but plastic or just got sent protectors for the wrong model)

Most of the time no issues though. In fact a couple times I got stuff delivered and a month later my money back because of copyright infringement and having practically unlimited 1$ off every order coupons is nice too (late delivery - package actually get delivered in time, but somehow they dont track properly in the app and I can claim a coupon)"
Is that with temu or aliex?
So many of it is on amazon its crazy. And the markup is unreal. I always look on amazon or ebay for what im looking for then check AE and buy the same product for 80% less
Lots of stuff for sale on Amazon marketplace actually comes from AliExpress sometimes via the drop shipping mode of trading so it seems like it comes from somewhere else.
Amazon is ten times better than Ali Express which is ten times better than Temu.
"Yeah, I feel like I’ve had the same amount of issues with Ali express that I’ve had with Etsy and Amazon (And AliExpress was easier to refund than Amazon. )"
"Hm, sounds like the stuff you could easily get domestically.

I buy on AliEx because it is THE PLACE for great and little known purely-Chinese electronics."
"😂
A knockoff or fake is not the exact same. "
LOL!
"""and even aliexpress and wish"" the ""even aliexpress"" I get, they usually have relatively quality products.. But ""even wish"" is just... Its awful. Nobody should use em ever. Theyre more scammy than all of aliexpress, their support and communication is worse than the literal scam sellers on alixpress, their delivery times are a mix of ""oh it was stuck in customs for 3 months"" to ""it arrived 2 YEARS LATER""(how in the fuck did that even happen to me). And somehow their prices are still horrible compared to all other chinese marketplaces."
"The US is a one ""people"" government. Honestly not much better than china and thats a hot take for way too many people. Atleast the government isnt ""censor everything, bad words about joe Biden mean u get jailed or killed"" but it is ""highly propagandaey, very little actual transparency with anything, all politicians just care about money and their own ass, and a million other problems i dont wanna list out in a reddit comment""

Yes data stuff usually gets dealt with relatively well but theres so many loopholes specifically in the US where if u dont opt out or opt in or say u dont wanna be a part of some data shit then u are forever apart of that now. Theres a reason US lawyers get SO much cash"
lol you think american companies are actually regulated
"I put the app on my iPad (different user ID) and my husband on his phone, then I asked my mom and one friend. They can delete the app immediately after, it still counts for you!"
"I mean.. That is pretty niche of a brand and even then temu doesnt sell main or unknown brands they just sell the basic no name brand like you said. But atleast 5/10 times anything branded you buy nowadays you could have gotten for 1/10th the price on temu but without the printed on logo. ASIDE for electronics atleast niche or ""specific"" ones"
"Not saying it aint cuz of temu, im just asking. But like, does your mom ONLY buy on temu with her card and doesnt use it much of anywhere else? Cuz I know 40-60 year old moms arent really the smartest with technology and just put their card anywhere they can if they ""can"" win a free iphone lol. Thats why those scams exist."
"Congrats your $1 discount has been upgraded 
*spins spins spins spins-lands back on 1$*

Pick 6 items in the next 5 minutes to receive this discount!"
Try going to a mall when cell phones didn't exist and trying to cost and quality compare and find the sales. Lolllllll online shopping is exhausting hahahahahaha
Hmmmm....I may be wrong.
"The charade is needed because the reward is small. Do some research. Only the new user % off discounts are worth it. You can ignore all the other ""cash back"" coupon rewards."
"AliExpress. 

I have once ordered stuff on Wish.  
Really simple ""LEGO"" figures (animals). The first order / new customer discount made it cheaper than AliEx.  
Never used them after that. 

Almost the same on Temu.  
Only ordered once for that first discount and never anything else."
"AE does have better deals on the same items than Amazon but not 80% better.  Maybe 50%, though!  And if you look a lot of times the prices will be really close which of course you would buy from Amazon.   Amazon generally has better quality, too.  Temu gets all the worst shit that Amazon or AE refuses to sell."
you're quite the prolific spammer aren't you
"Out of all these online trading platforms, Etsy has to be my favourite. I like the individuality of lots of the stuff on there and that lots of the things I buy are hand made for me."
"If I bought domestically, I’d be buying it at a higher price from someone reselling the same stuff from China.

I try to avoid electronics made in China"
"And high end, 300$+ fidgets too"
Domestically would be ideal but unfortunately it’s way more expensive and a lot of the stuff domestically they get from some of the same suppliers anyways pretty much most of our crap domestically comes from China!!
Do you have examples of purely Chinese electronics
[deleted]
"You are right. But I swear to you now... I had a chance to hold both products in my hands and except for the VS logo on the purse, they were the same thing! I wouldn't have believed it unless I saw it for myself. And as far as USB cables go, the $5 one and the Temu one was no different in construction and performance. I will NEVER buy an overpriced USB cable from an American business again. Putting an American name brand on a foreign product does not make it better or make it a knockoff."

And then you immediately go to your cart and half of them are out of stock. Or they cost more than announced. And shipping and taxes were not included.
Oh and the lines and traffic and just driving there and finding a parking space.  I just find this comment so funny. Like how much less could shopping get than online??? Hahahaa
I ignored all the new user discounts back then lol
"To be fair to Temu, some of the stuff they have is O.K. just like some stuff from eBay, Amazon and AliExpress is crap.

It's like buying stuff from anywhere really caveat emptor"
[deleted]
I Love Etsy but I don’t put them in the same category as Temu or AliExpress or DHgate or any of those to me I go there when I want something unique or handmade I don’t really agree with stores like Temu Ali any of them I personally wish we would go back to made in America but that’s not gonna happen so even though I don’t agree with children making things and fast fashion and the fact that we’re making the Chinese rich and opening ourselves up for scams and getting our information that’s why I always use prepaid cards just in case I still shop them because in all honesty I’m not rich by any means and if America made all these things for that cheap I would for sure buy them here first but we don’t I don’t like that I have to shop these sites but it is what it is. But Temu is definitely at the bottom of my list right with SHEIN I really don’t like most clothing on these sites because the material is just so weird it makes me itch there is a big difference with better quality clothing than cheap crap but for some leggings even bamboo pajamas that are the big hype right now I ordered two pairs for my grandson and they were just as good as Posh Peanut and all those big brands those people are insane literally people on their FB group going into bankruptcy from buying bamboo!! Team who has too many stupid games I don’t like how their prices seem to always be lower and then when I go to check out their higher because I’m not a new customer it’s all a gimmick usually your first order you get a bunch of free crap that’s worth doing but otherwise the rest are BS!! Their stuff is the worst of the worst quality. But I express I’ve never had issues with I got a few things that were not like described like you could clearly tell that they were dupes which is not usually what I buy but a couple times I have and I returned with no problem and didn’t even have to send the item back so then I was able to donate some nice fake Stuff to the local shelter!! OK I like to talk and my messages are already long enough I’m actually going on Ali rn need a few things lol!! so if you haven’t tried them out don’t be scared to give it a shot just make sure you read reviews and use common sense and keep in mind to pay attention to the reviews and that they’re real people leaving them and you really want them to have pictures of the items they actually get then you should have no problem!!
Electronics made in China are the best. It's something you can hardly get domestically. That's like an infinite performance-to-price ratio.
"Brands like Asometech, Essager, Toocki, Ubigbuy, Convoy, Sofirn, Bimawen, VChance...

Hell, you can get professional Lexar CFExpress cards for half the price, Colbor lights, Ulanzi stuff... Basically, there is a much wider variety and at more affordable prices."
"chinese power banks are the best, even japanese electronic stores sell them"
"Google-compatible tall RGB light bars that you place in the corner. Or dirt cheap lights you put in a socket that light up automatically when it's dark, draining only 0.5W each, curing my seasonal affective disorder."
It probably was the ones that Victorias secret sells I think a lot of the distributors actually make a lot of our namebrand products they just haven’t had a chance for the company to slap their labels on everything yet but then there are dupes not as many on Temu but Ali is full of fakes those are different those are companies trying to make some thing look exactly the same and have the labels on it that’s just flat out copyright infringement but when they’re selling the item it’s not illegal and a lot of times it is the same thing I know that one of the store fronts on one of these sites I don’t remember if it was Ali or DHgate or which one but one of them is the company that actually makes Stanley Cups and they sell them on there too they just don’t have the Stanley on it yet that’s the last step is smacking their name on it!!
"Wish would lose a lot of money on practically every sale back then. Afaik alie is making some profit and temu is sort of not making profit but also not losing a lot atm. At least from what ive gathered.

Though the reason temu doesnt lose a lot is because they stronghand sellers so seller have to either scam people (like delivering very poor quality) or make losses."
"Fair enough. Us companies are pretty much the same ""only care about themselves and about money"" as the politicians too. But fair point"
"BLM reporters and organizers critical of police were found dead in their car with a gunshot to the back of their head. Police ruled it ""suicide"". Also, remember that Boing whistleblower just last month?

"For reference I'm 39, so know what it's like to to shop at a mall as a child, teen, young and middle age adult. And then all the internet shopping that evolved throughout these past couple decades"
"True, the difference in prices on Ali Express compared to Amazon are the cost of fees.  AE charges sellers around 8% and Amazon charges more than 50%."
"ikr, the quality of chinese electronics has gone up so much in the past 5 years, really the only place you can find cool and cheap electronics"
They really are. Great priced stuff with all the features that mainstream brands offer and sometimes more.

all you have are low level conspiracies? typical CCP bot
"Yeah, and the ingenuity of it... AliExpress offers solutions to problems I didn't even know I had!"
"lmao - these are all pretty well documented by a number of independent reporters from many different coutnries, both inside and inside the west. Americans are the most propagandized people on the fucking planet, but you sure won't shut up about ""CCP bots"""
"Proof? none? huh, textbook CCP drivel bot, weird how you all follow the same script, yet get mad when someone calls it out. Have fun with the evidence-less conspiracy theories and the whataboutism, I'm sure focusing on those makes you REALLY productive."
"A friend of mine bought their crap all the time, until she got her info stolen and had to fight with her bank for like a month to get it all sorted."
TEMU is Chinese for “cheap crap”.
"TEMU steals your data for China (among others), like all data they can access on your phone, which is a lot. Further they don't give a flying fuck about intellectual property, working conditions or environmental problems of their production. So by buying from them you're basically supporting a company that represents everything bad with humanity for cheap products of mediocre or bad quality."
"It's cheap for a reason.

No different to Shein."
"Yes, some of the shops in Temu are a scam. I have a small business, and a seller on Temu stole my designs, photos, and listing text from my online shop. The sellers shop was filled with stolen photos from Etsy and other platforms. There's no way they could make the items they were trying to sell. They seller would have taken the buyers' money and sent an inferior item or nothing. We filed an IP claim, and the shop was eventually closed."
It's a symptom of End-Stage Capitalism.
"This is from wiki, and there is a lot of information there, I just chose the portion on consumer complaints:

“Some merchants use Temu as a clearing house where they attempt to sell off low quality, expired, or outdated products.[33]

According to Andrew Chow writing for Time, in 2022 Temu customers experienced a rash of undelivered packages, product discrepancies due to false advertisements, and mysterious charges, as well as unresponsive customer service.[10]

According to Sarah Perez, writing for TechCrunch in relation to Temu’s advertising campaigns, “These ads appear to be working to boost Temu’s installs. But dig into the app’s reviews and you’ll find similar complaints to Wish, including scammy listings, damaged and delayed deliveries, incorrect orders and lack of customer service.”[30]

In October 2022, the Boston branch of the Better Business Bureau opened a file on Temu; by the end of 2022, they had received 31 complaints from customers regarding the website’s service. As of January 2024 the company has a BBB rating of C+, though the company is not BBB accredited.[10]

In March 2024, BabyCenter did a review of the app Temu and said that the website had found products that have been recalled, could be counterfeit or circumvent U.S. safety standards and features that are important in preventing issues like choking.[34]

In May 2024, the European Consumer Organisation launched a complaint against Temu with the European Commission alleging breaches of the Digital Services Act concerning trader traceability requirements and algorithmic transparency and accountability.[35] The same month, the European Commission stated that Temu must comply with the Digital Services Act.[36]”

So, scam or not, it sounds like a crappy place to buy crappy products."
Wish 2: The Wishening
I use it for things of dollar store quality that I can’t find at a dollar store if that makes sense. I used a coupon on something I had in my cart. Its was originally $15 and I got it for 0.01
Not a scam in as much as you pay for something and they send it to you. Not everything is going to be of exceptional quality though. But then you should know that going in by the prices you're paying. A lot of the stuff I see on temu I also find in high Street budget shops usually marked at least double what temu would charge. And it's not all crap even if it's not top end. Not really sure about whether they steal your data or not. I mean would it really matter if the person collecting your data is from China or the US since it's usually just collected for advertising anyway. I garuntee reddit is stealing your personal data so it can target ads towards you as well. Facebook certainly does as does every other reasonably large social media site
"It is the cheapest, cheapest junk! I tried to send it back multiple times and it wouldn’t go through"
Yes. Fast fashion sucks.
"Temu is so cheap because they sell all your data, so don't use them either way"
"Temu is legit, but the ""free stuff"" advertisement is not really a good deal. You will only get ""free stuff"" if you keep buying more and more and in the end it's not a good deal.

The items on Temu are very cheap, so if you see anything you like, just buy it. Don't fill up your chart untill you can get ""free stuff"", the ""free stuff"" is usually a very limited catagory of products that you don't need anyway. 

The quality is very different for every item. I find the clothing to be very low quality, some pieces are nice but you never really know. Home decoration items, accessories or things such as electric hand fans or compact mirrors with led lights are quite good. I got a rechargeable electric hand fan for €5 and it's amazing! I also bought a lot of cheap sunglasses from Temu and they are nice. It's like Aliexpress, I'm sure the items come from the same chinese factories."
They do identity theft or some shit. I wouldn’t be caught dead on that app/site. PS: TikTok can get fucked for the same reasons.
It’s all garbage. The clothing has plastic in it too.
"I've used it for a year or more. I had three items where I didn't like the quality, they promptly refunded my money, let me keep the product. I have many items that are exactly what you'd get on Amazon, but they are priced better.  I don't pay attention to the gimmicks they flash you."
"I’ve bought things off it that functions completely fine for 1/10th the price of Amazon. Like cables, socks, glasses basic stuff like that. I don’t get why people get so bothered about some of the stuff being shit, you buy 10 items for shit all money, get 8 functional items and 2 none , just chuck it away. It’s still cheaper than buying it from Amazon or some other supplier."
"Out of all the people I know that use temu, everyone of them has had a bad experience."
"Regardless of what you think of their product quality, which seems to generally bias towards the lower end, it does sound like the TEMU mobile app in particular is very heavy loaded with [UX dark patterns](https://www.thetimes.com/uk/technology-uk/article/temu-uses-dark-patterns-to-lure-customers-into-spending-more-pk9kfh72n) and have been[ accused of doing some shady shit with to circumvent security/privacy settings.](https://securityboulevard.com/2024/06/temu-malware-arkansas-richixbw/)"
Everyone saying “Temu steals data”.. can you please explain how? I’m genuinely curious to know what data is being stolen and for what purpose.
"Temu is bad quality from what I hear. Amazon is better, but there’s lots of knockoffs there too."
"Not nessarily an all-out scam, but...


Senator Marco Rubio has requested a DHS review of Temu's use of Uyghur slave labor.


The company has ties with the Chinese Communist Party.


The Temu app monitors activity on your phone via its operating system. 


It appears they are willing to take a loss on the sale of merchandise in order to collect data on its customers. 


All in all, I refuse to do business with such a shady company.  Each individual should decide for themselves whether saving a few bucks on shoddy merchandise and sharing their information with the Chinese Communist Party is worth their while."
"I’ve bought many things there, flashlights, chargers, door stops, etc.  stuff is cheap and OK.

They allow one easy “return” with each order and you usually don’t even have to return it.

My only complaint is the endless spins for special discounts (especially when fine print says everyone gets best results and it’s just for amusement) WHEN ALL I WABT TO DO IS LOOK AT TGE STATUS IG MY PREVIOUS ORDER.

My last order of about a half dozen items to get free shipping and the freebie went out S four separate orders.  One is late and I got a $5  refit because of it.   So I guess I’m buying again."
They looted me of my money and didn't even refund when I gave them the bank statement that refund wasn't received. BIG SCAM
" Avoid Temu like the plague, it's a data-stealing, quality-neglecting, and ethically questionable platform."
"Last summer I had a job working on a boat in Miami for a couple of months. I wanted loose cotton pants to wear.  I ordered 5 pairs from Temu for under $50.  I was worried about using a credit card so I used a gift card for the purchase.  The pants arrived within a few days.  They were what I expected:  cheaply made, cotton pants.  The colors were weird (not bad, just weird compared with standard dyes).  They were poorly sewn and the material was thin enough that it tore easily.  However, they were pretty much what I needed and what I expected."
"No, just cheap quality stuff that matches the low prices.

I use them for things I don’t need quality for, like metal shelving for a storage container (conex) that is just going to sit there and hold shit, and not 3000 lbs worth of shit."
"I’ve only ever bought it for party decorations, most of my sister bachelorette items came from Temu because it was one time use. I wouldn’t buy anything you want to last from them."
I got a cheap tool set off there. Nothing shady on my end.
I do t need anything that badly that I would do any kind of business with them. Its all junk
"You can get a lot for little, but in the end you are buying trash for money, so don't do it"
"Harvesting operation - looking for your personal information and habits, as well as inroads into your money trail. Just don't."
"Temu has extremely low prices for a ton of reasons, the two biggest reasons are that it's all cheaply made garbage only meant to be fun to buy, and they sell your data. Aka you are also the product they sell."
"It is a legit app, and some of the stuff is ok if you don't want the best quality products. DO NOT PUT YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IN THE APP, buy with a third party like a credit card."
It’s not a technically scam as they do mail the stuffs you ordered. But there’s no free items unless you hit certain amount of purchase. Don’t buy anything closely touch your skin. You just never know what is inside those extremely cheap items.
"I wouldn't use it only because those cheap prices most likely comes at the cost of child labor and under-payed laborers, as well as work safety precautions for those laborers AND safety requirements for consumers. I wouldn't order it through Amazon either. I assure you, there are safer local alternatives that are affordable, and unique to boot. Go to a Saturday market or look for craftspeople in your area, especially artist guilds who are full of people just happy to get 10 bucks for something they made."
"If you remember it, it is basically a flashier wish.com. Wish was just an easier to use AliExpress.com. Most of it is crap. Sometimes you get lucky. Often for inexpensive things you try to return it and they let you keep it anyway. It's almost Gauranteed to made with suspect materials by people in very poor working conditions."
It is China owned. Enough said.
"I haven't used that site but I've heard nothing but bad about it, so I avoid it."
"We have spent at least probably over $500 in total buying random stuff off Temu. Things like baby clothes, office stuff, adult clothes, office stuff and etc. I have never had a problem with them, they're cheap and obviously you have to accept that you get what you pay for but I have always had good experience with them. The quality is decent enough and I use Paypal to buy from them, I never got scammed."
"I'm sitting here working on a gift for a friend. I bought a pre-printed cross stitch kit from Temu. It beat trying to find a cross stitch store, trying to find a chart, buying fabric, floss, needle, and needle threader, then taking twice as long to stitch because I have to count. The floss isn't DMC, but it seems to be holding up well. My only gripe is not getting 2"" of fabric on all sides, so I can put all four corners in my Q-Snap frame."
It’s junk quality
"Kinda. The quality is subpar, think quarter machines at the grocery store quality."
"I’ve thought about using them but decided against it when I saw that apparently having the app uses *wayy* more data and power than a simple shopping app should. I’m not one to subscribe to the “Chinese spies are everywhere” conspiracy, but that definitely gives some credibility to it."
"I bought an xxl top... the label said xxl but the size was actually a xxs and the material was so synthetic it would have still been unbearable to wear even if the shirt was true to the labeled size. Yes it is a scam , i wouldnt buy a single thing from them after that experience"
"they stole 2000 shekels from me

"Oh my gosh!!! \*\*DONT\*\* get TEMU. It sells cheap garbage for cheap prices. Even if you get past the crap quality, it steals banking information and can make fraudulent purchases on your bank account!!!"
"Can you accept my invitation so that I can get a free gift?

"Yes they are scammers, will offer you all sorts of free stuff and then you fill your cart and want to go order. Then suddenly all the free items are removed from the cart.,"
Just use a cash app card
"firstly, just use paypal, never give a chinese site your bank details and second, it has now\* become a scam. initially (presumably to get new users) it was decent. now even a cheap 40p item, (which is worth 40p in the west) they will show fake pictures of and you will get the most hilarious version of it, pure plastic vs steel for example."
"The site makes claims such as 
""Check out to win $50 credit"" but it's bullshit. After check out you've gotta return to play some game which nets you another chance at that 50 credit after another purchase of however much they set it to. It's pure scam in this sense. Mfkr said "" check out to claim $50 credit"" not do this thing that stuff there and buy some more of our junk. It's full of this sort of false advertisement. Who can I report this to?"
"DO NOT TOUCH THIS CHINA WEBSITE THEY ARE ABUSING THEIR WORKERS WHO ARE SOMETIMES UNDERAGE, AND THEY DELETE YOUR ACCOUNTS WHEN THEY SEND 'DESGRACFUL ITEMS OF CLOTHING'. SPREAD THE WORD GET THEM CLOSED DOWN."
Yes I can say about videos on YouTube. stop using Temu!
"I was using temu a lot . I found most things were way better quality than I had hoped for . But the last time on app I had ordered about 50 dollars worth of things . Then I got a warning from my credit card that 400 dollars worth of things were trying to be purchased. I’m sure Temu did not do this but somehow my app was
 Targeted and I’ve not went back . Sucks as I really liked 99 percent of goods received."
I ordered a small hand held vacuum for the inside of my car. The video in their ad showed the vacuum sucking up all kinds of stuff. What I got was this unbelievably weak vacuum that couldn't even pick up cigarette ashes. I never bought from Temu again.
No
Temu and EPIC run the same scam they both sell a cheap product and steal your info and both are backed by China.
"The actual buying and shipping is legitimate. I bought a few items and they arrived. But my card info was stolen after buying from them. Someone attempted to spend over 2k on it, jokes on them I'm broke af and never have that kind of money. Had to shut down my card and get a new one, never had this issue before using temu. "

Why is everything deleted
"You cannot trust Temu! There have been multiple instances where I’ve paid for items, but they never arrive, and when I go looking for the items in my order history, they are not there. They are sneaky AF. Also the way the order history is setup is garbage because every single time something happens to your order you get a new prompt (ie. Your order has been packed/shipped/arrived in your country etc.) in it so you have to go digging to find my purchase. Annoying, and most likely intentional."
Its not bought 15 orders
"Short answer, yes.  It's a Chinese data farmer disguised as a consumer goods company."
"TEMU Is just like Amazon. All the stuff that you find for cheap on Amazon, you can find it cheaper on TEMU"
very good info. use it for things i dont need quality for. thank you all!
"We ordered a cap/visor with flames and faux Guy Fieri-like hair.

We got a fleece hat. Had flames, though."
"I've gone to Temu expecting very cheap products. I've been very surprised with some of the quality I've gotten, and in a very good way. I tend to getl pins, 8xl sized clothing, cat toys, and a few electronic accessories. I've also gotten a few hard to get board games. 

I wouldn't get anything that you're super dependent on from there, as delivery tends to take about 3 weeks , but out of maybe 20 orders, I've only needed to get one item refunded, and the process was really simple.

Expect cheaper quality, but enjoy the occasional gem or two."
"Seems like there are many Temu haters, my sister order her tenis shoes from Temu and they seem fine."
"There's a lot of fairly entertaining ""stuff I bought on TEMU"" videos floating around.  Watch a couple of those and see what you think."
"Yeah, I have so many questions about that especially after I just saw an ad for a portable welding machine that has its own helmet that’s probably not even approved to the same safety standards required of such helmets here in the US so it would probably burn your retinas out of your skull 💀"
"No it isn’t. I’ve purchased far better quality things off of TEMU than places like Winners, Marshall’s, or popular department stores. For a fraction of the price. The discounts are real. The quality is excellent. You just have to read the reviews and not be a sucker. Sure… there’s crap on there for suckers. But most people are suckers."
"do not EVER use your credit card, use apple pay or Paypal. my sister paid with credit card and her info got stolen and she didn't even realize after months later. better to avoid but I know some things are way cheaper there"
My parents used it. Their credit card was stolen both times. Almost every product was unusable due to incorrect sizes. Finally convinced them to stop trying!
Of course it's a scam. What about it seems remotely legit?
The free stuff has to be chosen from a limited list of items. Also you are on a timer to choose it. Plus you have to purchase other items to get your free items. Youll panic chose items you dont really want and then wait for them to arrive. In the UK they get delivered by Evri (Hermes) and even before they arrive youll start getting scam emails from what looks like Evri trying to get payment details for redelivery.   Then the items arrive and the quality is very poor.
"Here's a little know fact about Temu: you can return 1 item from any order no questions asked per order. That's good and bad. 

If you have a return cuz it was junk or the description was way off - which you should expect ALOT! - just submit and 9 out of 10 times you get an instant refund and don't have to return the item like Amazon makes you do with even $10 stuff.

The bad thing is they'll only be that easy on a single item per order. So order only 2 or 3 things together so you can get an easy refund if it's crap.

I like their stuff, but I know it will be slow-shipped (2 -3 weeks most of the time) and I'll be getting a quality refund on something in almost every order. So I don't order my Amazon items from them."
"I got sent the items fairly quickly when I ordered ( like 2-3 weeks) and yeah, they are cheaply made, but were also cheap and what I needed. 

China already had my data cause I shopped at Aliexpress too 😂"
"Define a scam?   
imho temu is not a scam. You get what you get, and you get what you buy. 

How temu can keep the costs down? Well. I am not buying from temu anymore."
"In my experience, no. I only buy cheap things from the service and never electronics.  And belts. Paying 9 dollars for a belt and it breaks doesn't make me feel as stupid as paying 42 dollars and the same thing happening."
"If you’re going to buy from Temu I suggest using after pay or Klarna, that way your information is safe and you won’t get scammed later on. 

I’ve got a few things and they’ve held up well. Like bathroom organization stuff and other small things."
I bought a hoodie for like four dollars. Just as good as anything from target or kohls…
"From what I understand, you don't give your details to Temu, but instead use a Paypal protocol.  If you do give Temu your directly details, then what you describe has happened far too often. I've made one purchase there, and used PayPal (which I use once every 2-3  years, but if there was ever a time, it was with Temu). I was in OP's position and also wondered if legit. Everything I ordered was as good or better than I expected, but I purchased wisely, did my due diligence, and look at sizing of everything.

Also worth noting, I didn't use the app, but used the website on a locked down computer. No way I'm installing the app on my phone."
"It wasn’t stolen, it was sold. Temu is so cheap because they make their real money by selling your info. "
Hahaha it's not crap. 
LMAO FR?
[removed]
"All that may be true, but do you think for one minute that the average American CEO gives a crap about any of these things?"
So I should buy the same stuff from the same manufacturers on Amazon?
">So by buying from them you're basically supporting a company that represents everything bad with humanity for cheap products of mediocre or bad quality.

This explains why I can never open my email inbox without yet another Temu ad in there."
Please repost this 1000 times. Thank you!
Pretty much similar to Tik Tok.
Among us
"With modern phones, especially Apple, they cannot access anything from your phone if you install the app.  
they only have control over what you input in the app.   


I am a engineer in the mobile industry and make apps for a living"
"Man no offense, your data is out there already. and really how important are you for your data to be valuable?? Are you Elon Musk, Or A top 1%er"
And the crap we buy at Walmart is made by those same people.
Mind explaining how exactly they do that?
"And the stuff you’re buying might not just be cheap/easily broken crap, it might contain dangerous levels of heavy metals and other nasty shit you’d never want in your home. If you have kids, HELL NO, it’s like inviting cancer into their bedroom"
"I mean, yeah. I didn't really NEED a dog treat dispenser, but I got a good deal for two. I don't have any regrets... or a dog."
Wow. Thats hellaaaa deeep
😂😂
"Oh hell, if you’re gonna drop truth bombs, how are these people going to be able to feel all superior for buying the exact same stuff at 6 times the price at Walmart or Home Depot or their local store?"
"Exactly, buy off the website (not the app) and pay with a credit card. I've returned a few items and was told to keep it and got a refund immediately. Larger US chains take days to process a refund. "
"Technically its cheap because it buys in mass bulks where price per product averages very low, then sell with a markup where they have profit. Extra profit is recieved from selling information yes, but bulk purchases is the main reason for low prices (plus the 25€ minimum or whatever other number it is depending on the country)"
they are so cheap because they can get human beings to work for them for a couple of cents and once those human beings are dead they just get new ones so its not a problem at all its actually pretty straight up thats the main reason why its so cheap all the other aspects are not as big as the fact that china has their workers completely under control
"I agree with everything you said. I've never had a problem with them. I go in with expectations quite low, and sometimes it meets that, other times I've been really surprised with how good the quality is for something so cheap. 

Their electronics do seem to be nice. I bought some awesome led fairy lights, aquarium filters, and even a mini sewing machine that works phenomenally. Most clothes have been decent enough, and I love using them to buy cheap fake jewelry that I don't have to worry about taking care of/losing it. 

Plus, their refund policy is _amazing_. If you're not 100% satisfied with a product, just send them a few pictures and they'll refund it in seconds- you get to keep the item. I wouldn't abuse this though because they will probably nix your account if you do it too much.

As for the data mining/selling, as an American I couldn't care less. Everything we do online is monitored and sold no matter what. Hell, our social security numbers were just leaked... I'm not too worried about it, maybe I'm naive though."
"Thank you, I've been wondering the same thing, thank you for answering"
"A week after ordering from Temu, I experienced credit card fraud for the first time in my life (someone bought an iphone). I suspect Temu was the source because I used a credit card that I hadn't used in a long time and Temu was the only purchase on it in a year, and on temu I formatted my address in a slightly different way-- the same way the fraudster used. "
Not trying to be a dick but I gotta ask… did you check to make sure there wasn’t a plastic wrap on the filter cartridge? Just asking
I have no clue. Very strange.
"I mean you do you I guess, but make sure to check out [this guy's reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1f016ll/comment/ljot2v0) mentioning how they steal art, pollute and waste resources, and use sweat shops. I'd urge you to avoid at all costs, not just for low-quality things."
"It's 2 groups of people, people that use it and like it, and people that have never used it and hate it"
I thought I was the only one
so you’re saying as long as i purchase via paypal im good?
J
"That's like saying ""I didn't punch you, your face made contact with my fist"". It's the same thing."
Pretty sure it is
"Oh they definitely don’t, they’d farm and sell our data in a millisecond. Thankfully though, we have consumer protection laws in the US, though I will say they’re very basic. The EU does a much better job of it."
You should just not buy cheap Chinese shit you don't need
"or you can buy it from a white privileged person who happens to order it from ali baba and then packages that shit multiple times to create more waste and shit there u go, tag their original artsy etsy store on ig and maybe u get even extra cool points"
Yes. And pay more for it.
"Just until recently that horrid site practically held my phone hostage,....before I knew better I bought something from them and got millions of messages and emails non stop.
I now avoid this site like the plague."
"Gotta prepare in case you get that dog in the next 10 years.  
They can go into hoarder pile 335.69 in the spare room next to the Shamwow and Slapchop."
Well said lol. Not to mention them complaining about spying and data being sold. The American government does the same shit as well as our corporations.
"they don't buy anything, they're like Amazon or Costco

they have set up warehouses for more commonly bought items

but the products still come from individual manufacturers 

they make bank with their margins, the CCP gets another app on hundreds of millions of phones in enemy countries"
"I bought a watch for $14 and I have to say it is great. I've had it for 6 months and keeps perfect time. Most of the stuff I have ordered from Temu, I've been very happy with. I also got a dash cam for $1.49 that works just fine."
"I'm not about to provide a guarantee on behalf of TEMU. Best I can say is that my PayPal lies dormant, empty, and for a single purchase in the entire year I used PayPal to buy TEMU, and only spent what I could afford to throw away, on stuff that didn't need to be great quality, and the stuff arrived and I got no funny business warnings thereafter. I certainly wouldn't use my debit card, and probably not my credit card, so yeah I reckon a solution like PayPal, or one of those services that creates a temporary card from your account, is the way to go. At least until (/IF) TEMU improves its reputation.  Oh, and again, don't use your phone. Most of people's woes seem to stem from that wheel which pretends you've received credit/discount. I just X out of it each time, knowing its there to make me a slave to promoting the site."
Not really. The big difference is the terms and conditions - you technically consented to your info being sold. 
The EU sucks there's countries there that limit the amount of overtime you're allowed to work.
"I don't. I buy cheap shit I do need though, and I get it from temu rather than my local stores who are also sourcing from the same Chinese factories."
"I just want to point out that not everything from China is shitty. There are good companies there that make good stuff, but there’s also 1.4 billion people there so that’s going to skew the shitty numbers."
Amen. It's so simple.
"How can I ensure they are white, and what threshold of privilege must they have for to meet the criteria from ordering from them?"
Must they be white?
Douche
This is why it's crucial to not order through or even download their app. I only order through their website using my throwaway email address.
"The data consent doesn't apply to sensitive information, which means there was theft."
No they didn't..they did not agree to having their money stolen duuh 
Only if you download the app. Not unlike any other app out there. 
How does it “sucks” r u ok?
"Imagine being mad that a governing body prohibits your employer from having you slaving away 24/7 at an unfulfilling job, telling you to have a life"
Depends how much you value your private data tbh
"After you buy enough cheap shit that breaks easily or doesn’t work, you learn to spend a little more on quality the first time.  

Otherwise you end up buying the same item multiple times"
where did i state someone has to ensure they are white? im just saying bying shit from an etsy shop can be as bad as buying from amazon and that can be as bad as buying from temu and it doesnt matter if the company is chinese or if its just one white person i was trying to sarcastically imply that its the same shit
whats wrong with them being white? hahah
"but you probably still provide your address and CC info

they keep and archive any data point for future reference, it's simpler to just avoid it

if you really want to go use it pay through a friend or whatever"
"The fact that you assume my job is unfulfilling and that I have no life because I actually work towards something says everything I need to know about you. No, fuck that, I'm not a kid, the government doesn't get to tell me I'm not allowed to work 60 or 70 hours a week. Only the COMPANY can tell me that. That's reasonable. Here in America if mandatory overtime is an issue you either strike, work for someone else, work for yourself, or don't sign up for it. My work does optional they offered 80 hours a week but we never have to work more than 40. People are entitled to go earn their money so that they can afford a house, car, bills and still have money left over to invest and spend. Pay off debt early. My work offered 80 hours a week. I typically worked 50-60 and only 40 were required. Not because we're bootlickers and depend on daddy uncle Sam, but because we striked and got ourselves a deal. This helps the working class and businesses. But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you? You strike me as a communist who's mad other people have a drive to work harder and accomplish more than you."
"You mean do i want it going to Google/Amazon or the Chinese gov't, what's the difference?"
"FWIW,

Lie.


Buy prepaid credit card for cash
Give fake name
Only real info is the ship to address"
"“The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money. 

Take boots, for example. ... A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars.

 ... But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that’d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years’ time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.”

Terry Pratchett - Men at arms"
I don't need lifetime wall hangers or shower shelves lol. I wouldn't buy tools or electronics from temu.
"Items I've purchased on Temu that have lasted 6months-1year so far without any issues:

* Caster wheels (that can even withstand the weight of heavy items like an espresso machine)
* A small strainer for removing canning liquid from cans
* Magnets to hang remote controls on a wall
* A microwave cover that can be stored on the roof of the microwave with magnets (costs around $3 on Temu, goes for $20+ on Amazon)
* A soft ""base"" to put under a KitchenAid mixer so you can slide it around the counter
* Small retractable measuring tapes
* Handheld desktop vacuums that charge via USB-C
* Various hooks/hangers/other small organization items

For random little items to use around the house, I think Temu is fine quality-wise. It's not all going to fall apart in a week. It *is* better to spend more on some products though, like hand tools, or certain appliances, or anything with a solid warranty (Darn Tough socks and Vitamix blenders come to mind). 

But Temu isn't 100% ""cheap shit"". There definitely *is* cheap shit for sale, but the same is true for AliExpress and Walmart and Amazon and Target and so on. The app has its issues, but this hasn't really been one of them in my experience."
"While this is sometimes true, it is often not true, and folks are just spending hideous money for near the same quality products just due to a name and marketing.  

I'm currently using wireless headphones that cost me $25. I've been using them daily, about 10 hours per day, for the past 5 years. They work perfectly. Is it Bose quality? Nope, but I'm listening to game walkthroughs on youTube, not listening to Pink Floyd vinyls. Similarly, I bought bluetooth earbuds for $25. Used 6 hours per day for the past year, still working great and a lot cheaper than my wife's $150 pair. Worse reception, if I go 30 meters from my bluetooth adapter, which I don't do because I'm sitting down in front of it the whole time.

So the flipside to your statement would be stop paying for overpriced crap which just has a recognizable name but is often made with the same components from the same factory as the cheap shit, but with branding and marketing added.

90% of expensive electrical equipment has components from China. Most expensive clothing still touches someone's hands in Mexico, Asia, or Africa. 

My montblanc pen gathers dust. I prefer my $5 inkgel pen from Target.  Expensive =/= quality more times than not in my aged experience."
"This. My American, European, and Swiss made stuff have lasted me my entire adulthood."
"Hmm. So stepping away from sarcasm and witty speak, where would you suggest that we can purchase higher quality goods that aren’t just cheap Chinese products that may or may not have been repackaged for marketing.

What is an actual alternative?"
"Nothing wrong with someone being white, it just makes you look dumb when you say it that way."
"Do they support Google pay? I always use it with shady sites because that way the vendor doesn't get your actual credit card number, that info stays with Google. But of course they do get your address..."
I love it when my prediction about a person is spot on
"I do appreciate that benefit your employer gives you of doing optional overtime in exchange of more income. That's an option I would have like when I didn't have a baby.

However, in other countries like mine, overtime is not always paid and some companies abuse that. And even when overtime is paid, companies require overtime because the management couldn't plan the work well. It's required, and not optional like yours. So in this case, I also would appreciate a government's protection of limiting the overtime hours.

It's tricky. I do wish there's a way a government can protect employees from abuse but at the same time, give people the freedom to do overtime as they want, with proper compensation."
Amazon won't steal your credit card info at least.
"The difference in the outcome might not be easy to calculate, but there is a bit of a difference in how that stuff is used and what it’s used for. Ultimately neither you may directly impact you, but also if someone has my data, I’d rather it be Google then someone who might be more tempted to steal my identity."
Exactly. It's expensive to be poor
You get what you pay for ! Especially electronics
There are no goods not made in China.
"I dont think im dumb for seeing the fact that chinese companies sell horrible quality products to some white individuals who pretend they make that stuff at home and then resell it as homemade, but also i could be smart and still be wrong on that haha"
"Yes, Temu supports Google Pay"
"Same here my guy. You might not get too far for not working some overtime, but that's what I think. You do you though."
Lol
"I think you have too much faith in Google, to be frank"
"it's not ""then someone"" it's ""than someone"".  It's hard to believe a person that can't write their own language."
"When's the last time you had your credit card info stolen by using Amazon? I remember one unsolicited order and that was over 15 years ago. Might have even been me accidentally ordering while sleep deprived in college. I dislike Amazon too, but they're no Temu when it comes to being sketchy."
Lesser of two evils thing. Never used temu but I often hear about the issues. You not having experienced them doesn't mean they're not there.
Chinese bad ; Americ good. It's the same shit and he's trying to justify it
"Data breeches happen all the time. Temu is no riskier than Home Depot or Albertsons.

I use a separate account only for cc payments and have to personally approve all transactions over $20, so this isn't something I even think about."
"You've never used it...I never said I haven't had issues.

Thanks for this useless comment."
"If you can't get grandma off Temu, consider pointing her toward craft supplies. My daughter adds stickers to her craft projects and she goes through them like nobody's business and it's nice when we got 1000 of them for $2 or whatever. Tell her you'd rather get things like stickers, washi tape, those little rainbow scratcher papers, air dry clay."
"They’re so so so dangerous. They do not follow any US safety regulations for choking hazards, pieces being able to break off, loose magnets, lead etc. They’re tossed as soon as they’re received."
"I told folks to please not purchase cheap items like that for my child - and gave the example of folks finding lead in those items, and said we wouldn't be keeping them if received. I suggested one quality item or money for his education savings account if they really want to give something (child is just an infant right now, but this sets an ongoing expectation/boundary). I don't think some people understand the issues with ordering from places like that. Capitalism at it's finest!"
"Ughn yes, and the button batteries. Omg, why are there so many button batteries batteries in everything?!? Love an item that breaks immediately into sharp chokeable pieces and reveals a lethal battery underneath. Merry Christmas everyone."
"Just be firm.   “I don’t care if they need toys, they need safe toys.   Quantity does not mean quality.”"
"My mom gifted my daughter the most cheap clothing imaginable. Like plastic leggings with jeans printed on them, fake rips and all. We said thank you and it almost immediately went into the trash. 
I’m not asking for expensive clothing just something that doesn’t reek of chemicals and won’t rip first thing in the washer."
I don’t let my kids have anything that’s not from a reputable brand. Even stuff sold on Amazon is sometimes from suspect Chinese manufacturers that could be coated in dangerous metals or plastics.
What happened to our family to a T!! Grandma even said she is obsessed with Temu and how she “overdid it” with Temu. We could hardly keep a third of the junk we got😭😭
That is rough! I actually read yesterday that Amazon has opened a section this is a direct competitor to tenu with a bunch of cheap junk from China😭
"I had a temu pop socket puzzle toy immediately start overheating a battery where it was burning hot to the touch after about 5 minutes, and started melting the plastic, and the battery was about to burst."
Omg so much yes. I do t care if you spent $10 total on the junk. Just buy one book that would be so much better
"I made it clear this year that we didn't want anything from Amazon.  I had such horrible experiences with amazon customer service last year, that I canceled my account, and said no more.

I find, I actually purchased a lot less garbage that I didn't actually need this year, as I wasn't bombarded with ads saying ""you need this immediately.""  And if I was, taking a second look at alternate resellers usually took my mind off the ""need this thing immediately"" aspect.

I saw a documentary recently on Temu.  It's pretty awful... from reselling straight garbage, to hazardous waste, to just straight up slave labor.  Make sure she knows about the leaded toys, and the slave labor.  Idk that anyone could justify shopping at Temu after that... >\_>

The documentary in question: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnu\_UcaRZv8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnu_UcaRZv8)"
SNL got it right… https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKTN2OiR2R8
"My mother in law is OBSESSED with Temu, I feel your pain!"
"""You are so generous! Thank you! Honestly, we're sort of particular about the stuff we let the kids play with. I know, silly old us. A gift in their honor to (cause) would be really meaningful to (kids)"" we say, year after year, when asked what our children would like for (insert day). And year after year we are resoundingly ignored and wind up with massive amounts of (possibly leaded) junk. That we then donate or discard. That all winds up in a landfill or, more likely, the ocean. My head spins thinking about how much all of this cheap shit is actually costing us and our descendents."
"My MIL did a bunch of Temu-ish shopping last year (probably Amazon still...), like she did a search for ""[age] Xmas gifts"" and got the first handful of items. This year, she did last minute shopping which required shopping in person. Much much better gifts, so thankful."
"Honestly just give it back to her and say you don’t want it because of the reasons you said, keep doing it until she gets the hint. 

She can waste her money if she wants but there are safety standards for a reason."
"My dad and stepmom are very well off. Upper middle class, have been since early 2000s. 

Growing up, anytime I asked them for clothes my stepmom would buy very nice quality clothes, and my little brother was the flyest little toddler I ever saw. 

Fast forward 20 years and I have two toddlers of my own. For their birthdays, she’s been getting them temu outfits that *look* cute, but are of the same quality as Walmart Halloween costumes. 

Super thin, terrible quality that lasts a handful of wears before they start fraying or just outright falling apart. 

I really just don’t understand it. She even buys the crap for herself now, and when I was growing up she wore designer clothes *only*. They could just buy *one single* well made outfit, instead of 10 outfits of terrible quality for $1ea, and we would be way happier with it."
Throw it out. They’ll not miss it
"the Boomer ideation of acquiring stuff has got to go.  


I feel like I'm the only person I know that considers the full life cycle of a product, including it's time in a landfill, before purchase.


I own too many things but I do try to buy quality stuff that can be passed on or donated"
Gotta just toss it at this point rather than keep all the junk. If you said so in advance and your boundary was ignored you are not in the wrong.
"My MIL is also a quantity-over-quality type gifted. It's exhausting. Even my young kids say it's too much and immediately donate half of it when we get home. Thankfully she hasn't gone crazy with actual Temu, but I'm sure that's just because they don't ship fast enough for her."
"Get the lead and cadmium test kits. Film yourself testing Temu gifts before your kid knows they're in the house. Send her the footage. I've had to do this before. My mom is a compulsive shopper. We test items on the spot, and she knows that."
"My mother in law did this and I gave everything right back to her immediately.

Be offended. Idgaf."
"I posted this on Facebook and got roasted! Lol. 

But my question is, what can we do about it. I want to educate people on the toxic exposure,  the ego driven ways of purchasing etc. I want to make a movement to reduce our waste for future generations.  So frustrating.  This is only the start. 

-----------

Temu for Christmas anyone? 

Personalized cutlery for toddlers. 
Not sure if I trust the things. Toxic metals? 
What is your thoughts? 

I really appreciate the thought of all our gifts etc, and don't want to sound ungrateful because I know some families go without.. but I am kind of disturbed by the amount of crap we got and the quality of the toys. 

I'll be gifting all the things away to someone who finds value in them. 

For instance: 
🐀 Bubble blower gun thing, hard to pull trigger once it got wet, pretty much broken haha

🐀 Cutlery,  who knows what heavy metals are in these 😵‍💫

🐀 cheap and nasty clothes, actually a few things were nice,  but you know what, I'd prefer nice opshop finds without the chemicals. 

🐀 Skincare. Omg. Just no.. 🤮😂 why put this uncontrolled, unregulated stuff on my face. Not even my feet. Maybe when I was young. But now I am so much more aware of the damages it causes us and our children's hormonal systems etc. 

🐀 wooden/ painted products. Lead in paints? Wood treated or not? My little one will chew on these. 🤮


Anyway, sorry rant over. Just be aware of potentially toxic crap. 

Merry Christmas 😂🎄😝"
"Anti consumption. 

I hate how these pages have taken over. All we are is trash."
"Look at the parent company of any corporation you deal with, find their HQ and their nation state.

Choose with your wallets.  Explain to people who'll listen why it's important to recognize when a global market vendor is anything but about pushing as much crap into western nations that don't rely on their goods otherwise."
"My kids have gotten stuff from Temu/Wish as gifts and I don’t even feel comfortable donating it to Goodwill or other second hand stores. It goes into the trash, which is also a terrible choice. But better it go to a dump than some poor kid choke on a tiny piece that falls off."
"Oh no, the Temu gauntlet strikes again! It’s the thought that counts, but when that thought materializes as an avalanche of sketchy, dollar-bin chaos, it's hard to keep smiling. The kids’ faces might have lit up initially, but it sounds like you’re now left staring at a post-apocalyptic wasteland of busted plastic, noise machines, and itchy regret.

Maybe it’s time for a strategic plan with Grandma? Something like, “The kids would *love* something handmade from you, or maybe one *really* special item instead of lots of little ones.” In the meantime, you’re left plotting the logistics of a garbage removal operation that doesn’t scream, “I threw out all of Grandma’s gifts.”"
"Just toss them in the bin.

I was clear with my mother, you buy shit, I'll toss it in the bin."
"PSA: for people in the EU. Anything that does not have the “CE” logo on it has not been certified for use in the EU. If it is a electronic item - there is a non zero chance that this thing will start a fire and burn down your house. Note that your insurance will not cover the cost. 

Same goes for non EU countries if you import shitty non certified things"
"I feel this in my soul about SHEIN. My baby is 6months and we received so many SHEIN outfits that I’ll never put on her. I appreciate the thought as well but half of the clothes fall apart after one wear, the words on the onesies melt and stick together, the sizes aren’t accurate, and the material feels cheap. 

Clothes are one of the biggest contributors to pollution. I wish they’d just save their money."
"My kids are older now 13 & 15 but my mother in law used to get just cheap crap body sprays, soaps, etc. the stuff all made in china. Our youngest was even allergic to disposable diapers as an infant and had to wear cloth so she couldn’t have any of it! I finally told my mother in law that her son throws all of it away because it’s made in china and youngest gets skin rashes from stuff like that. She finally got the clue that she was wasting her money because it was going in the trash. Grandmas mean well but Temu and china seem to be better than nothing which is often what these grandmas had. I feel bad for them but we have to protect our kids. It is what it is."
I talked to my mother in law about this and used the “it’s probably toxic” angle. No grandparent wants to give their grandchild lead poisoning.
"It could be worse.  Grandma in my family never found Temu. But she still buys all the Temu garbage that is on Amazon for 4x the price.  So now I get the same garbage but Grandma spends a lot more money on it.

I've got thousands of knock of legos that don't fit together"
"UGH MY GRANDMA IS OBSESSED WITH TEMU. Majority of all gifts or anything that she’s gotten my daughter has been from temu. Clothes, random small toys, shoes.. I toss everything because I don’t feel comfortable letting my 2 year old play or wear things that have come from there. I kindly thank her and remind her to please not order her or us anything as we don’t need it so I don’t  hurt her feelings. But MY GOODNESS. IT NEVER ENDS!!"
"I've bought stuff from Temu and 90% or so I've been very pleased with. But, I would not buy toys, makeup, candy++, jewelery or electronics from that site. I've had a bad experience with one of those things were I recieved a mail from them were they asked me to get rid of it due to dangerous materials found in it. You can tell grandma that toys should not be bought from Temu because there are some safety concerns with the materials sometimes used. You can search for it and find some examples to send her as ""proof"" and tell her you don't let your kids play with toys from Temu...Some toys are safe some not, it's a gamble with toys imo from what I've red."
"We used an Amazon wish list. Sure Grandma bought some temu-ish stuff, but those quickly got overshadowed by the gifts we selected for them. The other stuff either won't last anyway or I'll discretely dispose of them a little later."
99 cent store trash sold as if it's a deal at $10.
"Man Amazon sucks too. Now I just stick with established brands (fisher price, leap frog, Melissa Doug) or for smaller business brands that are  American/canadian/european brands (tubelox, kidamento, etc)"
"We have all been highly suspicious of temo in my house. Even my 9 year old who gets ads came to me asking if it was a scam and that he feels like it's a scam. 
I think you should tell your mother about the gifts. She might not realize yet that it's poor quality stuff."
Aren’t most stuff from Amazon is also basically from temu bc they come from the same manufacturers?
"I love Temu.

I got my daughter‘s Pokémon stuffies from there for like 80% off retail price. All in perfect great condition."
"We only have one relative who would be prone to that sort of thing, and fortunately she gives cash. My MIL makes snide remarks about the amount of cash ($5 or $10), but a small amount of real money is still real money and we are grateful. It goes in his savings account."
"Yes. My mother in law got me a ""veggie grill cage"" last year. Arrived 2 months late and completely demolished."
I'm sure most of the things with batteries or plugs are serious fire hazards.
"My friend and I make upcycled fashion accessories from thrift finds (giving second life to like, ugly scarves, or clothing that are too damaged to wear but that we can cut something else out of, etc).  Last time I saw her, she gave me some stuff from Temu!  :O 

I was disappointed that the Canadian government mandated Canada Post back to work from their strike, not only because I think the striking unionized workers deserve a fair deal, but because it means my mom's temu order for my kid for Christmas came in after all.  :("
"Anyone shopping at Temu needs to understand that the money they’re saving is from a person choosing the product for its quality. It’s possible to find high quality things on Temu for cheap, but you have to allocate time to have them ship it to you so you can determine the quality first, and then return anything that’s poor quality. I’ve found things that were tremendously high quality when I didn’t expect it and things that looked ok but I had to return immediately. 

The number of things I think are good that are also for toddlers is small but not zero… but it needs to be carefully thought through, and then checked by ordered (with time to switch to a different gift if it doesn’t turn out well)."
"My father bought our toddler a bunch of junk off temu. We've regifted and donated the majority of it. 

We told him before, I don't care where you get stuff but this crap can't stay in our house. I'm all for a ""deal"" but just buying stuff because it's cheap is just wasteful."
"My IL get those toys just fine without temu...

They got an eye for trash.

I kind of want to introduce them to temu now to set how that goes."
My MIL used to do this but now we ask for experience gifts! Like money towards a membership at the jungle gym or the aquarium.
Just throw them all away
"oh wow, that is SO horrible! can you open in front of grandma and show her the broken toys? even better if your kids start bawling right after they open it to see a broken present!!!"
i hate it too
Temu? Well isn’t Tim Tom Shop almost the same crud? How about Sheen too?! They all sell pretty much the same stuff!😬
"Girl Saaame. I hope Trump bans it. 


For all of the talk about ""global warming"" and waste, our Govt has done virtually fuck all yo crack down on this Chinese crap. "
"I always buy the kids an ornament based on something memorable from the year. I found Temu selling the one I wanted for 90% off. When it arrived, it was a blurry, shrinky-dinked photo of the actual ornament. My kids laughed and deleted my Temu app."
I also hate Temu. My ex husband's girlfriend and my ex-mil love Temu. The amount of times my kids come over now in Temu clothes is so frustrating. My son had a rash all over his back from one shirt. A lot of it is see through. I've started just sending it back in a bag after washing it. That means more of the clothes we buy end up over there but at least I don't have Temu crap over here.
"I knew Temu was sketchy. I could never put my finger on why, but crappy quality control would do it."
"I hate it so much, instead of banning Tiktok they need to banned that app"
More people need to learn that it’s better to give no gift than a bad gift.
"The problem isn’t Temu, it’s Grandma being cheap and not understanding what Temu is."
Just once I would like to spin the discount wheel and lose. Winning on temu is my curse.
"I buy from Ali express but im really thoughful on what i buy, usually i have more luck with it, i just buy some acessories, i have a few pieces of clothes and i bought shoes from a reputable brand, at least i know theres official brands in there. Ive tried temu and it was just crap, also i could find cheaper on ali too, shein its a hit and miss, but mostly miss, i always make sure to see pictures and god, either some people dont know what quality is or they are lying. I wouldnt buy toys from it or anything for my son, ive bought some clothes and whatever didnt had quality, was tossed over. My moms bf is always buying shit from it and its always annoyed and complaining that its shit, yet keeps buying??? I had to tell a grown ass woman not to buy makeup from aliexpress or shein either. I just dont understand, such a waste of money to save up a few coins. Ive threw away toys that were poor quality that i bought myself, just throw everything in the bin, dont even donate."
Yes......... half of it in the trash already. Such a waste
Did you tell the grandparents? And then tell them to never use them again??
How can you tell if items come from temu? Is it very obvious? Now I’m worried we will receive these items and not know
I would be kind but direct that you can’t keep any of it because it’s not safe. She’ll probably be mad but it’s the only way to eventually get her to stop.
"I’d never used them before this Christmas. Currently fighting with them over an order they said was delivered, but definitely didn’t arrive. It was worth a few hundred! Arseholes."
My mom found those sites where you bid on returns and overstocks. It's hell—so much junk. So many broken or gross items that some jackass left filth in. It's similar to what you're describing. He fucking garage looks like an Amazon returns bin and she tries to pawn it off on us.
"And now Amazon wants to be Temu. We've got a relative that uses it like a shopping search function, all on there and unable to differentiate between 3rd party shite and good stuff."
Boomers need to be banned from Facebook and tik tok for good. They're highly susceptible to targeted  ads for cheesy Temu crap
"Goodness I could've written this myself! She actually said as they were opening their presents on Christmas day that we (the parents) didn't have to worry about all this plastic taking up too much room in our houses because it'll all break soon anyway, like that's supposed to be a good thing!"
My mom gifted my partner and I a cumulative 80 pairs of silly socks from Temu this year..
My MiL bought us a chainsaw from Temu and it's going to be staying in the box until I find a way to offload it.
"I have the same issue with my mother. I just completely banned her from purchasing them anything from there. 

The irony is that she criticised my aunt for getting me a Barbie boat toy from a second hand store…the toy was still in the box."
I think 90% of my mom’s gifts this year were Temu. Luckily we are all adults and they mostly were somewhat useful and/or thoughtful. For me I think she just typed in “flamingos” in the search bar and went nuts.
"I made a post about being concerned I would receive gifts like this too! 

I don’t understand how sooo many people I know are okay with purchasing off Temu/Shein/Amazon without a second thought. It’s alarming!"
"My mom gets this dhit off Amazon and Walmart marketplace. I started throwing it out in front of her. A few years of this, now it's rare but it still gets tossed. I'm not grateful for toxic shit, regardless of the intent. "
"Grandma and grandpa also found Temu, boxes keep arriving…"
shits is gonna get worse with Amazon haul
TELL THEM!! I'm going to be doing the same asap!
"It's trash, throw it away."
"I’m sorry, but this is funny. I never liked Temu, but they sell everything for dirt cheap. This is heaven for the Cheapskates."
"In trying to embed the mantra “Less stuff, better stuff” around my family"
"*** sitting here thanking the heavens my ex-MIL hasn’t found temu*** she’s a chronic Amazon violator that sends junk to my kids ALL the time for birthdays or Christmas without even asking. My sons are 13 and 15, she sent them kanoodle and slime. Like wtf? They’re teenagers!!! They don’t care for those things yet the grandma never cared to ask them “hey, what would you like for Christmas?” 
My kids don’t have it in them to tell grandma they would like other stuff. So all this just goes in a box for re-gifts for little kids birthdays."
"If she insists on buying from Temu (I’m a fan myself but also I know what I’m doing!), try and steer her towards art and craft bits, these are usually a safe option from experience. Stickers, little notebooks, clips of all kinds, washi tape, colouring pencils, ribbons and bows, diamond art kits and supplies, make your own bracelet kits, hair bobbles. Tell her toys of any kind will go straight in the bin as they don’t conform to any current safety regulations. Say it loud!"
"My kids are older but I just keep a  donate boxes in the garage and toss stuff in after the holidays.  We are always accumulating little trinkets, even the kinder egg candy have junky toys. 

I did notice that a bunch of Temu and Amazon stuff is the same.  My daughter got into crocheting and we have received kits from Temu and Amazon that appear similar.  Even the expensive Wooble kits were marked “made in China”."
Lmao 
You just described my father in law lol 😂
Don’t worry. Once the tariffs start even Temu will be too expensive to buy. 🙃
"I will just throw away, secretly. I am not the one 😂"
My mom won’t stop shopping at Temu and keeps wondering why her credit card number is constantly stolen…🙄
"I buy tools, electrical devices, irrigation valves and water storage equipment and so far things have been good quality.  I see Temu as a logistics innovator figuring how to get something from Asia to the US for less."
"It took us until this year to get my MIL to quit buying so much cheap garbage and instead get less, but what they actually want. For her it's a trauma response. She lived in a car growing up, then her abusive husband made her put any gifts for her kids (my wife and SIL) into a ""hope chest"", so now she wants to overcompensate. 

We greatly appreciate any gifts someone is willing to give, however 90% of them ended up broken and in the garbage within a few days"
"Don't download the app even though they give away all kinds of free sh. it. DONT.DO.IT. It's China and they sell ALL your information.  All the crap on TEMU is trash, literal trash. Just.dont.do.it."
"She's shoppin like a billionaire


Sho sho shopping like a billionaire


Sho sho sho shopping like a billionaire"
And everyone at my school makes it out like temu and shein are so cool
Throw it in the trash
It's tough. You know grandma means well and just wants to try and provide everything see couldnt for her grandchildren. You don't want to be mad cause her heart is in the right place. But your in the right as well. So things to try are maybe asking grandma if we could make gives about activities next year. Go to a lights display or even some baking together time in kitchen. My aunt was similar she wanted to get us good gifts for Christmas but was very broke and was worried if she didn't get good enough gifts that she would not be welcome next year. It took some time and lots of talks for her to realize that she is family and that we only want her to bring her presence because we love her. So remeber it's fine to let her know but just also remeber that she is doing her best to show her love.
I’ve found Temu is only good for very niche specific items. Toys…. Hell no.

"There’s a ton of junk, but also some great bargains."
Literally my SIL’s neighbor got lead poisoning from their clothes
Give her an Amazon Wish List with cheap options.
"Maybe you can give grandma hundreds and hundreds of dollars next year... Or you can save that money and go shopping for a better attitude for yourself. Be glad someone is loving your children and thinking about them, instead of being an ungrateful twott (you know, like YOU are)"
"1) you can get lead testing swabs from AliExpress/temu. I bought those and swab everything.

2) you can buy wooden Montessori Troy’s at 1/5th the price of US. I have lots of those

3) instruments. 

4) larger toys that aren’t choking hazards


You just have to know how to search. I love those Chinese sites it’s a gold mine."
"This is horrible and the toys aren’t even safe from that place at all. That site is notorious for false advertisement and reselling straight up trash and making you think it’s something else. They also come from workers camps and slave labor places. Bummer that Amazon is now turning into Temu as well with their “competitive” sections. My husband tried to get a bunch of gifts from Temu for Christmas this year, unbeknownst to me, for my daughter and for me. My daughter didn’t really like what he found for her off of there but she didn’t know how to react and focused on her other gifts. It was a horrific experience to open up a box of complete cheap, tacky, and fake trash for my “gift” from him for Christmas, and he felt so naively proud of it too. I have always shown him that I’m a high value, high class woman, so I don’t know what he was thinking. I would have preferred no gifts over this box of trash. At least I saved most of the gifting for my daughter with what I purchased for her that was better quality from other places. I only got a temu box of junk for Christmas that my husband picked out for me. The vibes off of all of it alone were horrendous, and all of it was complete and absolute trash. I kept it together for my daughter so she could have a good Christmas, but let me just say that I spoke my mind to my husband later, after my daughter was outside playing with her new toys. I will never be receiving a box of junk for Christmas again, and neither will my daughter. I hate Temu. I made a family rule that no one ever shops there again in our family. And Amazon is also to be avoided. My husband has since apologized for his mistake after I talked to him, and now we don’t know what to do with this box of Temu junk. From now on, our family will be going out and find quality gifts for people instead of falling for the online marketing scams that get you cheap quality while spending more in the end. I firmly stand by quality over quantity, and that was a big lesson my husband had to learn this year from Temu."
"Show her shein, it's better quality around same price."
What is temu
Just educate her.
Why not tell grandma to stop? That's how adult do in case you miss it
"That's a really good idea. I'm going to do that, thank you!"
"Shit, my daughter did this with bandaids. I got the cool ones, so she also went through them."
"This. Santa got ours a Kindle, a pencil box, a Hello Kitty cup and a big pack of Miraculous stickers. She spent 90% of her attention on the stickers."
I bought 6 sticker packs a year ago and I’m still handing them out to the kids as rewards.
"I work in after school childcare and often use Temu for craft supplies. I wouldn’t buy clothes or anything electrical from there but glitter, Ribbon, glue, paint, clay and loads of other amazing craft supplies are cheaper than my local shops and cheaper than Amazon."
I second this- all the craft stuff I've got from temu and shein has been great for my crafty 6 year old!
"This woman wouldn't be happy with crafted gifts. If you can't already tell by the tone and tinner of her post, she is an entitled spoiled thankless person. She would complain regardless. You could give each one of her Rugrats a $1,000 gift card, and she would complain that it was only good at certain stores."
It's wild how unsafe their toys are. You can just look at the stuff and see ten different ways it can kill a kid. Screening the items is such a nightmare.
I can't believe they're allowed to be sold here. What's the point of having regulations if Chinese companies can just swoop in and ignore them all.
"> Temu is an online marketplace operated by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, which is owned by Colin Huang. It offers heavily discounted consumer goods mostly shipped to consumers directly from China. Temu's business model has allowed it to become popular among consumers but has also drawn concerns over data privacy, forced labor..

This is first and foremost on how they are seen publicly.  Make sure to name and shame."
Wb products from amazon? Aren’t most stuff from Amazon is also basically from temu bc they come from the same manufacturers?
"How old are your kids and how do you handle them knowing you throw their gifts out? What do you tell them? In previous years, I could easily get rid of it without the kids noticing, but this year my oldest is very aware of everything she got and I don’t think I’m gonna be able to get away with it without an explanation."
"Do you not watch your children when they play? Or do you just give them a shitload of sharp dangerous things and tell them to go play in a corner by themselves? I mean really, does your child need a bicycle helmet to go booky on the potty? You do realize that it would not be allowed to be sold here in the United States if it didn't meet our standards?"
"They just don't care. I've suggested the 529 account for gifts. Or companies near us that make wooden toys. Education contributions are declined because ""there's nothing to open."" Real toys are deemed too expensive. Toxic broken crap shipped halfway around the world, though, is right on budget!"
We've tried. Grandma says we're too fussy and kids need toys.
"> Capitalism at it's finest!

ahh yes state funded sweatshops in Communist China churning out mass produced dross for Americans being taxed and inflationed to death in favor of the rich is definitely ""cApItAlIsM aT iTs fInEsT""."
"Meanwhile, Mrs. Thor just found an electronic fox at my Parents house that she had when she was a kid, and it still works just fine.

I have no idea how... the thing has to be nearly 30 years old, and you can't replace the batteries... its fully sealed..."
Never thought of that. What would happen if you swollowed a battery?
A kid would love a rattle with rusty nails inside. There’s a reason we don’t give them that
"We got a unicorn dress, except the unicorn has such weird lumpy posture and is so red-eyed that it's clearly been smoking pot. For a toddler."
Everything on Amazon these days seems to be stuff people are drop shipping from Temu anyway
Same! And pieces breaking off causing choking hazards.
Right?!? It's ALL garbage. Even the stuff you can keep.
It's there a way to avoid said section? 
I saw a commercial for this last night. It’s still in beta. Amazon haul.
Is this not already what Amazon is? There's a degree of further enshitification?
So just regular Amazon then? Lol
"We had terrible experiences with Amazon this last year, plus all the barge junk that keeps getting shoveled in and replacing everything good, so we cancelled everything with them as well. 

At this point I want nothing to do with that company, though unfortunately they're still the only place I can secure specific things.  I'm stuck ordering from them every once in awhile just because of this issue, until I can find new suppliers...."
It’s maddening isn’t it? Ours won’t stop either.
I made a “toys to play with at Grandma’s” basket and took it to her house.
"Take a picture of everything you’re going to throw away and send to grandma. Let her know it’s going to waste, maybe she’ll stop buying junk."
"This is exactly what I would do, and do do when my parents try to give me or the kids stuff that we haven't asked for and don't need. Like my dad bought me a pair of scissors. Good quality scissors. I already have an identical pair though so I didn't accept it. I just don't have space for everything that's on sale that crosses their path. So I say no. Dad was left with the scissors. Lesson learned."
"Solid comment. 

My 2025 is out with Amazon. I haven’t fully committed to drop prime, I want to be I also watch a lot of shows there…. But I am giving up purchases on Amazon and the likes unless I absolutely can’t find something local, and that’s doubtful. 

If Amazon had a ”made in US/Canada/Mexico“ etc section insight consider that. And I do know not everything at the stores in made here, but At least I can feel it likelier contributes to jobs in my community.

Sigh, hope my sentiment is coming across in this very short comment!"
"100 times yes! The other thing I do ( especially on Amazon) is looking up the brand name (if not known) to see if there's a US based location. If there is any and  it looks legit I'm usually ok with moving forward. If it doesn't I know they can sell on Amazon and not have to adhere to any safety standards. I also look for Europe Regulation compliance as that's more stringent than the US. 

I am also very suspicious of resellers so I tend to only choose sellers from the brand or Amazon directly. 

I think people don't realize how much is unregulated on Amazon that's sold directly to us."
We've told Grandma exactly that. Grandma believes that Democrats cause hurricanes but that lead concerns are... somehow also lies by Democrats? I don't really understand it myself.
"Yeah, common sense is king when it comes to Temu. I will never buy anything that plugs into anything. Great though for art supplies, baby doll clothes, knock off legos, and knock off magna-tiles."
but is it really okay to regift or donate this stuff if it's not safe and terribly made?
Hahaha where does all this junk come from? Is there a garbage boutique I don't know about?
One of the problems is definitely Temu being a shithole designed to pawn off unsafe crap on unsuspecting consumers.
It can be both!
"Sometimes the package is marked Temu which makes it easy. Sometimes it just has Chinese postmarks. Lacking that, it's visibly cheap stuff with Chinese instructions/labels. There's no mistaking how flimsy it all is."
What?? Why? I don't understand 😭
I got socks too 😭
Omg there is nothing on this earth that could entice me into using aTemu chainsaw
I ask my mom to get the kids stuff second hand. Buying second hand is much more thoughtful regarding their future.

*twat
My neighbor ordered an Owala bottle from Temu and it was delivered from Target. I wonder if major retailers are putting overstock on there?
"Finally, thank you.

I ordered many wooden toys, thay are extremely well done and honestly just the same as the overpriced ones I see in other places. Sometimes even the package is the same...

Many companies have the same base: ""jobs"" in China for no cost basically, but the ""more reputable"" ones just add their own fees. Same with Shein and sorts. The suppliers for, say, H&M, are literally the same. Even bigger and more expensive brands, all owned by the same and from the same suppliers so many damn times.

So I'd rather use Temu. It's honestly easy to check a product to see its conformity to rules and safety (even before buying I mean). I only bought some clothing couple of times that was shit, but *I* was to blame cause I didn't read the specifics...

I managed to get some stuff for my kid that I couldn't have been able to afford otherwise. And if I wanna buy locally I wait for the promotions at Aldi lol, many wooden things there for cheap, too."
"It's the new wish.com... 

basically, a storefront for Chinese knockoff/dropship companies to sell you straight garbage for pennies... meanwhile collecting your data and reselling it, and employing slave labor...

Old people love this as much as the next person set in their ways.
"I understand the sentiment, but no one here is afraid of communication. It's that we're holding the line on so many other issues that to preserve the kids' relationship with Grandma, we've strategically chosen to accept the gifts that are safe and throw the rest away. It's such a headache."
Oh you sweet summer child
"Yes, she might be liking their ‘sales’ so maybe you can get her watching those craft stores sales they have every week? Like “1/2 off sketch pads!” Etc??"
The idea of buying bandaids on temu is revolting ngl
Lots of children’s art supplies which were made cheaply were shown to contain benzene and other harmful chemicals. I still try to stick to brand name. I bought tape of Amazon and it had a terrible chemical solvent odor and was hard to tear. I returned it and bought 3M Scotch tape 
"No one suggested crafted gifts, I was suggesting Grandma purchase art supplies from Temu rather than toys. Many children like doing art projects and it solves the issue of having a lot of broken toys. 

You seem unnecessarily offended by this post. Unless you are the grandma?"
"Yes! They intend these things as a gift, but really what they are giving is tired parents another job."
"maybe its the China's hybrid war against our children.

seriously how those toys are allowed to enter country?"
"Can you not just be honest with your mother that the toys from the site don’t follow safety standards, so as much as you appreciate the thought and realize she couldn’t have known, best to avoid for the future? I get that you worry her feelings might be hurt or she’ll be offended, but jeez. If it was my mom or MIL I would just be honest and say thank you but the stuff isn’t safe, please don’t."
"I KNOW! It makes no sense, especially for children’s items."
Technically they aren’t being sold “here” (assuming here is USA for you).  You are visiting a Chinese company’s website based in China which is why they don’t have to follow the same regulations as company’s that sell products in the USA.
"Our country is poisoning us with food production, air control, etc.  What makes toy products any different?  "
"Yep, same thing. Any toys from random Amazon drop-ship brands with are just as unsafe. If it’s not Fisher Price, Graco, Mattel, Little Tikes, etc, it’s not being given to my toddler."
"They’re young so they don’t notice and we live far from everyone so they just send it in the mail. 

For older kids I would just explain to them ahead of time that such and such relative might give them a gift that’s not safe and is just complete junk so we’ll have to say thank you but throw it out at home, just as I would with anything that’s not safe."
"We knew daughter had ADHD and sensory issues, but she also had behavioral problems above and beyond.  To the point where we had her checked for lead several times because that would have been one of the better reasons for them.   (She is okay now, turns out a very social kid who makes eye contact can have autism if it is the PDA kind, and now we know how to help her, so many fewer meltdowns and her nervous system is no longer set to ""fight"" all the time)

We couldn't risk lead in toys.  She put everything in her mouth far past when a normal child does so and gnawed on things.  We did our best to stop her and give her safe chew sensory toys, but we had to assume anything was going to be put in her mouth.  (Believe me, I kick myself now for how long it took to figure out what was wrong).

Her grandparents were willing to go with better quality or books over cheap Temu stuff, and part of that is they watched us sort husband's legos into ""no lead"" and ""yep, Lego says maybe lead""  and only let her have the ones that were safe and do other work to keep her safe.  

But she grew up with us discussing how she was going to have everything in her mouth, and that limited her toys.   When someone we didn't know well who gave her cheap TEMU stuff, she knew she was not going to get to keep it, but that if she thanked the person kindly and didn't make a fuss, mom or dad would replace it with something she could use, OR she could make a fuss and it would become a supervision only toy, where she had to wash her hands after playing with it, play with only in certain, easy to clean areas, and be monitored and lose it if it went anywhere near her mouth."
It's so frustrating when the $80 item made of quality materials from a reputable brand is balked at in favor of four $20 items of questionable plastic makeup.
"That's exactly it. Quantity over quality, and getting to feel important by ordering a hundred things. Suggesting a better option that the kids would actually enjoy takes away the feeling of importance and thus we are declared to be ""controlling"" or ""difficult.""

It's not about us at all."
"Is there not a better in-between to guide them towards? Like maybe a toy from Target or Walmart is OK (in-store, not their new online marketplace for 3rd party vendors), but not from Temu or Aliexpress? 

There are plenty of affordable options at Target and Walmart that won't poison kids!"
Almost word for word experience for us too. These types of posts are encouraging in a way because maybe it means things are changing for future generations. I’m sorry.
I would probably just make it clear that anything from Temu would be immediately thrown out and then follow through. 🤷‍♂️
There's nothing to open... I'm sure my future 18 year old will appreciate finally opening a stacked college fund
"I don’t think it’s necessarily fair to hold it against someone that they want to have something for your child to open from them. 

If we boil everything down to value let’s just figure out  how much everyone wants to spend on everyone else’s net it out and just get a wire transaction for the net owers.

I get that it’s not the most effective use of capital, but sometimes just let your kid get a toy."
Do we have the same grandma?!
"I had a temu pop socket puzzle toy immediately start overheating a battery where it was burning hot to the touch after about 5 minutes, and started melting the plastic, and the battery was about to burst. so if gifting dangerous firehazards is what they wanna do. so be it."
Show grandma the toys she ordered. Give her examples so she gets it.
Just donate or trash it.
Yup! They don’t get it nor do they listen to a word I say b
Go no contact. My mom doesn't even know I have a son. I can't believe who some people allow near kids.

"This one right here, it’s the exact same stuff. Difference between Amazon and Temu these days is shipping times and price. If I see it on Amazon chances are I can find it cheaper on Temu.

"Amazon Haul. My husband told me about it and i was like oh nooooo, it's Amazon themed temu."
It’s in beta testing and you have to click it to see it. It’s called “haul” I think.
Yes. That section is called haul. You have to click specifically on it.
I'm not sure. I have not even.looked for it yet. I do know it is only in the app.
Gross.  Saying goodbye to Amazon anyway but this would have been a nail in the coffin.
"If you are careful about what you search for, Amazon still does sell good stuff, mixed in with all the junk. I personally only buy brands I'm familiar with or do research before I buy. For example we have really nice solid wood blocks made in Minnesota from a company called Uncle Goose. I ordered from Amazon because it would ship to my nephew in Hawaii for way cheaper. But I don't go on Amazon and just search ""wooden blocks"" and buy whatever comes up. 


This new thing is exclusively cheap stuff made in China. "

"Not just junk from Amazon.  Thing1 ordered an apple pencil as one of the last things we bought from there.  It was broken out of the box, and I had to fight them on a refund.  I bought a starter for my car, and it was the wrong one... didn't get the refund for nearly two months, and had to fight them on that too...

The last straw was when I went to purchase a trailer hitch.  It was half price, which was a pretty good deal.  I'd been tracking the price for months... Seller magically ""ran out of stock"" before they could ship it to me... Contacted Amazon support... they told me that there wasn't anything they could do, even though the stock page had it still listed as fully in stock (but now at full price).  

At this point, it's just a massive waste of time to shop there... I'd rather spend it looking for good deals on third party websites, where if it ends up sucking, I can bail without being tied to some platform."
"I'm not too old, as my kids like to tell me, but I do remember the  times of consumerism.

If you had something marked with  before  became our world stage reality, you had something quite special, typically.  It was nice being able to gift and get things  or  if you were in Canada.

Even if you point at the grass and tell them look, it's green, they will insist it's just an illusion lol. What's important is the safety of your kids. Personally, I would not except toys from Temu. Maybe you can make it clear to her that from now on you will not except toys from Temu. She should respect that."
"No, it’s not."
"Some people like this stuff. That's up to them. 

Maybe regift wasn't the right word, we just ask other family members we see later if they want it. They tend to. That's up to them."
There's normally a couple stalls selling well overpriced direct from china trash at most market's I've been too
"I think either Walmart or ""odd lot"" I might have that name a bit off. They don't use any websites or electronic services, they had to use cash."
"As I understand it, the app can be straight up predatory sometimes."
"But that’s exactly what it is, if I want something dirt cheap that doesn’t have to last, I head to Temu."
Right? She genuinely thought that was a positive!
Literal fucking slave labor. I can't believe that we live in a society that supports this.
Don't forget high amounts of formaldehyde and lead.
Don't care if she loves it. She's a big girl she can handle a little information that will prevent another Christmas disaster instead of being so afraid of communication that everyone just lives with it.
"I don't know if you know this or not, but Amazon sells the exact same items that timu sells. Same name, same item. Higher price."
Agreed. Wasn’t there something recently about toxic levels of something in Temu and SHEIN items? I meant to look into it but my husband mentioned it yesterday. 
It’s tough with Amazon these days even when you try to choose brand names because there are so many fakes on there. The way Amazon stores inventory means that you might select a brand name and store but get shipped a fake anyway. I’ve stopped buying anything from Amazon that might be even remotely potentially risky. Certainly nothing that goes on the skin or could be ingested. 
"This is true, but I still feel there needs to be stricter laws regarding imports. You shouldn't be able to just buy anything direct from China. These are big safety issues."
"LOL. Mattel alone has: 

Had a recall of over 20 million toys for lead paint this included Fisher Price toys. 

Made a Barbie that caught stuff on fire. 

Made a Cabbage Patch doll that devouring kids hair. 

Power wheels that had sticky accelerators and ineffective brakes. 

Don’t get me wrong I think Temu is hot garbage. But to act like Temu is unsafe garbage but then be all “if it’s not by a brand I’m familiar with like Mattel my kid can’t play with it” and thereby ignore all the very bad toys Mattel has made us IMO insane."
I think that’s what I’m gonna have to do. 😬I’m just dreading her telling the in-laws that Mommy threw it out because it wasn’t safe.
Which Legos have lead?
The handmade wooden toys cost like 20 euros here. I got a really cool airplane for 15. Some bigger trucks are 50ish. The wooden toys are not expensive. But we keep recieving cheap crap from people I wasn't expecting to get anything from. My kid is one year old and we already have too many toys. Please stop.
"I really think my kid would ultimately one day prefer a $80 gift that will contribute $250 toward education, or $4500 toward retirement (since you can roll unused 529 money into a Roth IRA now) over the stupid broken piano mat with a Russian accent that won't see out 2024."
"My kid is 12, and I've ALWAYS allowed makeup, even at 4 years old. Because I firmly do not believe in the whole ""it's sexualizing children!!¡!!"" bullshit.


No. It's face paint. And artistic self expression. If YOU find her single purple eyelid and other silver eyelid sexual, examine *yourself.*


Anyway, I banned ""children's play makeup"" before she got her hands on it. I found that it doesn't have to be FDA approved! And it's considered a TOY, not a health or skin product, therefore *no one* checks to make sure it is SAFE for children's skin!!!!


So I've made *sure* she had the ""cheaper"" but *adult* and official makeup products to play with her entire life. None of that lead and shit on her face! Plus it just works better, lol. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk!"
Ironically they could have bought your child a highlighter quad from a drug store and it would have been safer and cheaper.  
Or how my MIL does it - ignores the high quality suggestion for $80 and instead spends $100 on multiple suspect items. 😭 make it make sense
"Time to set some boundaries with grandma!

There are multiple articles out there with stories of Temu products not being safe. Send one to grandma and explain that you will no longer be accepting anything from Temu. "
It's not going to be stacked for the price of a few Temu toys.
"We all do, I think!! It's so frustrating. My mom has been to our house and seen the knockoff Chinese brand stuff she bought broken immediately after use, and still buys it for us. (Thankfully I don't think she has discovered Temu but there's no shortage of that crap on Amazon). Yesterday's winner was a toddler camera (that I asked her not to buy on principle bc so many little parts and connectivity issues I don't want to navigate with a three year old hanging on my back) whose instruction booklet is entirely in Chinese. 

Following the Consumer Bureau Protection Agency on instagram has been validating for me (they do weekly haul's of recalls and safety warnings, and also are ridiculously meme-y for a federal agency social media account), but it's so frustrating - I've asked her again and again and again to just buy one thing from Fisher Price, or a museum annual pass, or nothing, instead of 17 things from offbrand Amazon sellers, and it just does not compute."
"Goodwill, Red Cross, Salvation Army, and many similar places don't take stuff from Shein and Temu."
"Some of the stuff is literally dangerous, so donating isn't even an option.

And we don't need to product and waste mone on more trash either :("
"Lol, I'll hit the gym and delete my Facebook too"
Ohhhh the honey is news to me! Thanks. I would have just ran to the ER but that's great to know.
"Temu actually steals product photos from Amazon, but when you actually order the item it’s just some junk that kind of resembles the one on Amazon. They are literally the biggest scammers on the internet, I don’t understand how people can use that crap they sell."
I'm pretty much switching to Target and places that have physical stores for this reason. I'm sick of wading through brand names that are just a bunch of random letters.
"You might as well use AliExpress, marginally more exxy than Temu but seems to have a higher minimum quality. You still get what you pay for price wise "
"Oh good, a further step in the race to the bottom!"
Yes that automatically came up when I opened Amazon the other day and I was like him wtf is this! Get my app back I just wanted curtains not the Amazon haul page of junk
"Man, I'm so glad I deleted amazon last year... their storefront was already loaded with so much garbage from offshore dropship companies... its so hard to sift the good stuff from the bad nowdays... -_-"
Standard Amazon has been Amazon themed Temu for almost everything for a few years now.
Thank you! 
Got ya
I had no idea what it was about until now so I’m glad I saw this post. It’s all the stuff temu sells.
Ah ok yes they absolutely should.
"Oh yeah absolutely, but the stuff that comes up first is absolute junk."
Ha! That might actually work.
Why would you want anything like that? To exist in the world. 
"Basically, nobody cares, unless it's happening to them... It's been happening for millennia, it's just better documented now... >\_>"
The idea of buying bandaids from Amazon is also revolting lol. Amazon’s quality assurance is a mess.
Yes I agree! I’m glad there is more awareness about this issue. My friend got temu balloons for her kids bday and everyone blowing them up got dizzy from a solvent like fume :( it’s just sad 
"I actually have never bought anything from Mattel as an adult (they’re typically made for older kids if I remember correctly, so not as much of a concern on choking, putting stuff in mouth etc) but yeah US toys are going to have recalls. That’s a feature, not a bug. A legitimate brand is a necessary but not sufficient requirement for our family."
"Haaahaha, thanks for reminding me of the nightmare cabbage patch doll."
lol yeah it’s a risk but maybe that’ll be the catalyst to get them to stop!
If it's something your kid will be upset about I would offer to exchange it for something similar but safer. That way it's not quite as harsh as saying you threw it out and is less likely to come up to the in laws. If they ask about it and she tells them then you can use it as an opportunity to tell them how much you appreciate their intentions or whatever but you just weren't comfortable with it. Hopefully they learn going forward but if they don't then no shame in tossing their gifts in the future.
Some of the colors from when we were kids - we have al list somewhere and their is a chance of lead and a chance of some other heavy metal.
I’m sorry what’s this bit about rolling that bad boy over?
"Good for you! My neighbor’s daughter burned her eyelids after applying child’s princess packaged eyeshadow. It looked incredibly painful for weeks. My sons aren’t interested in makeup so I have no experience with it, but it would not have occurred to me that toy makeup could be so dangerous."
"This is often the case with stuff marketed to kids. One of my friends gave both my kids harmonicas. I gave him the ""what the fuck have you done to my life"" look. But, he's a music teacher and a parent and he assured me this was a good idea. You know what? It actually wasn't bad. At least the sound coming out of a proper harmonica isn't awful. My nephew had a kids one that came in a cheap set of music stuff. It was brutal! 
 Also, kids dress up clothes like the dresses from Frozen. They are so cheap these days but they are actually regulated as toys which means they don't need to be as flame retardant as clothes. 
 Buy good stuff. It's cheaper in the long run and better for your sanity."
ELF and other pharmacy store brands are great for this. My little boy loved when we'd get fancy in face paint 🤣
"Interesting how China has all of these heavy restrictions / regulations on what crap can be imported into THEIR country tho. 


I firmly believe that their ""mandatory animal testing"" policy for makeup is just an excuse to tarrif shut down imports of organic American made cruelty free makeup companies bc they're cheating. 


You may hate Trump, but he is 100% correct on this issue. 


I'm tired of our consumerist crackhead dependency on China's junk. Yeah, I said it. 


I'm sick of the flimsy excuses too.


Well, I'm basically an impoverished American, so how ELSE can I prop up my consumerist overconsumption addictions without Temu and Shein? 


Our grandmother's managed just fine with a single tube of lipstick. 
Hell, 90s early 2000s folks did just fine with some basic staple items. 


Oh but i DESERVE to have Ikea drawers stuffed full of counterfeit and cheap makeup.
Oh but i DESERVE to have more shit than your average pop up kiosk/storefront in the mall. 


I'm sick of this nightmare culture "
"For me it’s the sister in law.  She spent like $200 to send a birthday package to the kid full of misprint pens and junk jewellery.  I am not kidding that it was a hundred pens.  

She buys so much shit, and then we are stuck with overweight suitcases and an overflowing room with little hope to organise it.  Why not get one fabulous item instead???"
"I hated that kind of stuff even as a kid, because I'd get as attached to it as I did to anything else, and then it would break and I'd think it was my fault. Then I'd be both sad and worried I was going to be in trouble."
"My MIL also does not care. She literally told me she bought a bunch of stuff for my kids and she doesn't care if it only last one day.

Like she knows it's junk and is a waste of money and she still buys it 🤦‍♀️"
Can you share their insta? Not sure if I’m finding the right one when I search. Thanks!🙏
I feel so validated in this thread!
Rofl I’ll hire you the lawyer
"Idk about target but Walmart is a marketplace like that too, now, so even with physical stores if you're ordering online you still have to check. It's obnoxious."
"Honestly I am really trying to stop my online shopping all  together. If I can’t find it in a brick and mortar do I really need it?

But your right Ali express is probably the most cost effective."
"We ditched our prime membership last year and now rarely use Amazon for anything. We accepted the free trial for the holiday season and it further cemented that we were right to ditch the membership. Late or delayed shipments, horrible customer service, a lack of accountability of their sellers etc. When I factor in the cost of a prime membership, I can basically get everything local for not much more than ordering online anymore. And if I do need to order something online, I check other places first."
Definitely. My MIL is notorious for buying junk that just looked cute on Amazon. I just threw out this plastic crocodile thats middle is the tube that expands and contracts and has blinking LEDs inside and no doubt button batteries. She gave it to my 2 year old who didn't even like it.🤷‍♀️
That’s a really good idea!
"Yeah, that caught my eye too and was news to me.

[Looks legit](https://www.savingforcollege.com/article/roll-over-529-plan-funds-to-a-roth-ira), though, from a law signed in 2022 (thanks to Biden and unanimous Congressional Dem support) which went into effect this year.

Only red flag seems to be that there's a lifetime $35k cap on doing rollovers, though it's hard to imagine there's gonna be any left in there after the cost of college for most people."
"There are [substantial limitations](https://www.savingforcollege.com/article/roll-over-529-plan-funds-to-a-roth-ira) but unused 529 funds, up to 35k per beneficiary, can be rolled into a Roth. A 529 beneficiaries can basically use the 529 to contribute their annual max to a Roth without a tax penalty"
That is horrible 
better for our country too. 
uscpsc
hahaha much obliged
"You have to filter for ""Sold by"" and select ""Walmart"". Otherwise yeah their website defaults to a garbage marketplace of random crap."
Target is good if you filter for store pick up (you can get it delivered) but at least you’re sure whatever you’re getting has some level of being vetted (they do sell online only things that I rarely trust)
Wow so so scary. Button batteries in American branded products are already scary and unsafe enough!
Thank you!
"That's clever. Even if you want it delivered you can filter and search that way and then swap it before you check out. I'll have to remember that, thanks!"
"Exactly! It’s been a very reliable way for me, good luck to us both!"
"An Australian finance writer says that Temu has found a way to combine shopping with gambling. “Sure it might be crap, or break quickly, but it’s so cheap, I can take that gamble”. That’s exactly what you see here."
"Man that's intense. So much money down the tubes

With that they could've bought like three actually cool and/or useful things that WOULDN'T break in a week"
"2k on temu in less than a month,  that's insane 😱😱😱 wth can you possibly buy"
reminds me of when i worked at a bank and we had a client whose account was always overdrawn because his wife would just buy shit on amazon all day every day. we took away her debit card access and she just used his so we had to take his away too. he’d get paid and have to come withdraw their mortgage in cash the same day so she wouldn’t spend it. we eventually ended up having to shut down their bank account. i felt so bad for the guy but also he kind of enabled it.
"This person may have a genuine problem.  This could be a symptom of a much bigger issue that's got nothing to do with spending and 'stuff'. 

If they don't have their financial future locked in now,  I'm not sure they will have a future to look forward to if they don't receive help.  

I'm not implying that responsibility is yours OP. Nor am I overlooking the ripple effects from this consumption. This one feels like it's more than the buzz that comes with whimsical purchases."
"i need to know what could possibly be bought on temu for >$500. i’ve never looked at temu, do they sell furniture or something?"
I remember using AliExpress and I'd get wheels you could turn to get extra coupons or win prizes. I get why people get addicted. It's like a game.
"Temu: Cut out the middleman, buy directly from the slave owners!"
I don’t know their financial situation but… this is genuine life-ruining behavior. Have you considered an intervention?
What are they buying? 
"Jesus. I got suckered just into *downloading * the app and was struggling to fill a cart with enough cheap, plastic BS to qualify for all the ""discounts"" and gave up pretty fast.

Shopping addictions would make a little more sense if they got good stuff, but it's always the most asinine, useless, and breakable shit ever."
"The app is purposely built to be addictive. I would not be surprised if the developers looked at how slot machines are programmed and used the same principles for the app. 

There are *constant* flash sales. *Constant* ""you have this coupon for only 1 hour""!! And *constant* notifications for random stuff. 

I bought some stuff on Temu last year when I moved into my apartment. Mainly storage and organization things. But I noticed that if you put things on your wishlist and leave the app for some time, when you come back some of those items will *automatically* be added to your cart. If you don't catch it, you might end up spending double or more than what you intended. 

Once I had what I needed, I deleted the app. The gimmicks largely didn't affect me because 80% of the stuff being sold didn't interest me. When it comes to buying sketchy junk from China, my rules are: nothing that touches food, nothing that goes on my skin, and nothing that plugs into the wall."
"Damn I wish I had that kind of money to waste on random garbage

Not that I would of course"
This is gambling
They’ve gamified shopping. This won’t end well.
That’s heartbreaking.
"This sounds like a clinical issue akin to hoarding or shopping addiction more than ""anticonsumption"". Clearly Temu isn't helping with purchasing things that folks don't need. But I'm not sure that it really benefits anyone to see this."
Damn this looks like my medical bills in collections lol
I thought Temu was a scam? I also thought they were like laughably cheap so how much are they buying?
"Woah, this is 5x my monthly salary, what could they possibly buy for this much"
"Temu functions like a pokies machine. Whizzing and whirring and flashing and everything designed to make you feel like if you spend more right now you get more value!!! Go! You only have a few minutes left..

It's horrible. I did one order and as I'm a real bad bargain hunter the constant notifications for more money off and stuff was really hard to not just buy up hundreds of dollars of junk just because."
This is actually super sad. Damn. Is this person accruing debt from temu? Or can they afford this? Either way hard to imagine a spending habit like this
"People get into the same mindset on Temu that they do when there’s a huge sale. If you weren’t gonna buy it before it was on sale you didn’t save money, you lost it."
"ya it tricks you into buying stuff to earn bonuses and really rushes you

but bigger issue is, linking paypal you can accidentlly purchase stuff very easy, it removes all regular checkout verification stuff"
By family member I hope you don't mean spouse or dependent child. That is just gross.
"I actually like Temu. It's how you use it. 


Temu is great for buying repair parts.


I got a replacement part for my Dyson for about $8.50. The ring was detached from the canister. Dyson was going to charge me $180 to replace the entire canister.


I got some capacitors to repair my 17 year old Samsung TV. It wouldn't have worth sending it to the repair shop because it's so old. Local stores sell capacitors by the hundreds when I only need a few.


All those proprietor screws that needs special screw drivers!


Temu actually helped me reduce consumption by helping me extend the life of my stuff. I really think it's how you use it."
"I know somebody who posts their ""temu hauls"" on their snapchat story, and almost every day, they post SOOO much junk and the ugliest cheapest looking clothes I've ever seen. It's absurd, I imagine their statement looks like this, and also super annoying that this same personal complains about being broke all the time 🤦🏼‍♀️"
I have this little theory that the first shot fired in a US-China war is China maxing every US credit card and bricking every US personal electronic they can
I hate that people know temu is a scam and still buy from there because it's cheap. Everything and everyone involved is so unethical
"I would love to see a picture of all that was delivered put into a big pile.  Just to get an idea of what that much money in temu looks like.  I've never shopped there, nor do I know anyone that shops there.  

Tbh, I actually don't even fully know what they sell.  A bunch of cheap clothes and stage jewelry, I thought.

Edit: spelling"
"I deliver mail to multiple people like this. They get a package or two a day, easily five days a week. Always from Temu or maybe Shein. There's just no way they need that much stuff."
"My mother also has a temu addiction. She's not good with technology. So I have to order her everything she sends me a screenshot of. This time, it's a lot of Christmas junk. Fortunately, I sort of have power over what she buys because I can tell her it's out of stock. I think I've saved her a thousand dollars this way by vetoing stuff I know she won't love. 
But she still does spend quite a bit, I'm a temu VIP because I spend lots of money on there, and I haven't even ordered anything for myself. 
The way I see it, amazon and temu are equally bad.
I try to encourage her to shop local when she can."
How can anybody afford this?
This spending is worse than my friends coke addiction
wtf is temu
That's not even small transactions!
Must be nice to have enough money to waste on hoards of complete and utter shit
Holy fuck that’s is so terrible
Some people have way too much money
"If this is your partner, separate your finances and then end things. 

A parent, talk to their doctor (if they are on any medications for Parkinson's) and (if really elderly) you could look into taking over their finances.  

If you want to, you could delete Temu from their phone, add ""net nanny"" software, and attempt to block it through their Internet router.  Start sending them TikTok about the Chinese adding spyware to electronics and using Temu for mind control. Or something.

Edit: I saw this is your Dad and he is 75. You may be able to take over finances (especially if he agrees to this) and give him a greenlight card so he can have a shopping budget.  If the hoard is too bad you can force an intervention maybe by calling adult protective services or even the fire department. Maybe your Mom would be willing to take over the finances?"
[deleted]
"That’s crazy! I actually like temu but use it for basic cheap stuff that I would normally get at the dollar store (and only if it’s cheaper than the dollar store lol). Hair accessories, party decor, organizing stuff and the like…even then I’m careful to get things I’m definitely going to use because the prices add up!"
Jfc. Why do people buy literal garbage

Wait... How much ?!
Wtf
This person has to be breaking 6 figures right? Like wtf.
Yo what the fuck 😭
I’m shocked they’re actually receiving the items considering it’s temu
People ACTUALLY use Temu and buy over 30 dollars of stuff on if?? Is it like Shein where it has really crappy clothes that people buy or is she buying actual junk on it?
"I used to have a housemate kinda like this. Multiple packages would arrive every day from Wish. My other housemates didn't see a problem with it, they thought it was cute seeing her get excited about opening packages. Sometimes they ordered stuff for her."
Temu curates addiction which is one more reason to loathe it. I hope it gets banned and everyone can safely detox.
"Holy hell, I used to have a shopping addiction and even at the height of it I never reached these amounts or that frequency, they need serious help. At this point it's not about consumerism alone, it's about something really serious going on with that person.

If you have the means to help them, please don't get caught in their problems. Good luck OP I know this must be really hard to witness"
"Not to defend Temu or consumption, but a lot of times this might reflect sort of a pent up situation. Like, the person may have a list of things they want but can’t afford, and have been holding off for years for financial reasons. So they might have a spike in getting all those things at once since the prices are so low, and it’s quite possible that after the initial spike it dies down. Some things are a HUGE part of your life, like head phone or treadmills. But once these sorts of things are bought, there’s only so much bullshit a person can buy beyond the essentials.

And yes I’m aware these things can be break. But not necessarily will they break."
I bought from Temu before… I really can’t be preaching to anyone but def won’t be supporting it considering it uses slave labor too…
O was gonna say it can't be that bad but then saw the prices 😭
But Temu is literal crap. One look at their ads says all
"Yeah, once I actually looked into what temu was, I immediately put it together. This is gambling and fomo rolled into one site and it's is predatory af."
"As an Australian, I hate our gambling culture, and any minister who supports the industry should visit the tie festival in Fed Square."
"But this is like $1200 in 2 weeks. A lot to spend on good quality clothes (10 boots x $120, say) but this is on *cheap* stuff. So like 100 boots x $12. I’m really curious what they’re buying to see if there’s a way to justify it. 

If they’re reselling, flipping, or sourcing, eh I get it. If they’re staging homes or something, eh okay. Otherwise - what are they buying and where are they storing it all??"
Someone I work with has exactly this mantra. She has her crap shipped to our sites address (guessing her partner doesn't know about the habit) and almost literally every other day we get at least one and usually multiple packages for her. It's an ecocidal addiction and it sickens me. I honestly don't know how these people live with themselves.
"I found out recently via my girlfriend (whom I convinced to delete the app along with AliExpress, Shein, etc.) that apparently Temu has gamified it too. They've essentially got one of those shitty mobile games that are designed to hook you in and convince you to spend money on microtransactions, right in the app. It's appalling."
"Yes, it reminds me of gacha games. It’s annoying that TikTok shop has recently started incorporating those tactics as well."
"Temu is doing a few things to get people addicted/spending. 

1) multiple ""contests"" or ""games"" that give exclusive prizes. These prizes can be 70% off, 80% off, whatever. People feel like they have ""won something"", but then

2) limited time only! Buy it now! You only have 5 minutes! Don't stop to think about if you actually want this item or if you could buy it elsewhere, you need to buy it now! (Sense of urgency), and then

3) there is a ""minimum amount"" you need to spend before you can purchase. The app says it is necessary to offer free shipping, but either way, you need to go find something else to buy before you can get your prize. 

4) now you are looking at our other products, let's manipulate you to look at a bunch of different things so that you add it to your cart. You can't see the total until you actually access the cart, so unless you are manually adding up what you are spending, you are going to over-spend

5) ""almost sold out!"" ""Buy it now before it's gone!"" ""Limited time only!"" FOMO and scarcity 

6) when you check your cart, now we have ""you might also like!"" These products just so happen to be on sale right now, so why not add them too! 

The person then purchases the expensive junk, feeling satisfied they got such a good deal. But wait! 

7) there is another prize/game/sale because you are such a great customer! We value you so much! We are going to give this to you free (if you spend another $$$$$$) 

I downloaded the app and said yes to notifications out of sheer morbid curiosity. I got over 15 notifications in a single day, often giving that sense of urgency or FOMO. 

I can absolutely see how some people get dragged into it, especially those who are already vulnerable (disabled and bored, retired and bored, experiencing poverty, mental health struggles, etc) 

It's honestly terrifying how they put so much work into hooking people"
"I bought a few things from Temu. Most were decent, but definitely the new version of Wish. Once I found out they use actual slave labor (not pennies an hour sweatshop workers, literal slaves), I never even opened that app again.

Speaking of which, I need to go on there & delete my account, then uninstall it."
"As someone who shopped on wish when I was a broke teenager... this is exactly it. I never thought abt it this way either but like yeah. Some stuff I still have from wish like 10 years ago, like a necklace that is solid metal and never turned green or a beanie thats actually really warm. Other stuff was worth the crazy low price and fell apart or got thrown away quickly. It was worth the low price and I got the dopamine rush from spending money anddd receiving the package to see if my gamble paid off so to say"
"It’s very clever. You get a high price item (say, 60$) free, if you buy 5 low price items ($2). Sounds sweet, right? Except the high price item has also a very high rate of returns, aka it’s shit. You can return it but no money is sent back. 🤷‍♂️"
Anything that mimics gambling in anyway is going to be addictive.
The only cheap item I see is the $9 one.
Ironically that makes me less likely to buy temu unless it’s something I’m ok with being cheap. Which is also why I like temu because sometimes the cheap plasticky version of something is actually just fine.
"It literally is gambling:

  
They got me with one of those ""act now and this item is 1 cent"" things but you need to spend $35 or something and then somehow still don't qualify unless you buy another $10. After that one I gave up. I get it. It's a rigged game and I won't win."
"~~$3,076.53~~, by my count. \[Edit: $3,066.53\]

For comparison, $3k is the price of a mid-to-large HarvestRight homestead freeze dryer, meant for preserving thousands of pounds of vegetables per year.

This person is buying clothing at a rate of spend ordinarily reserved for industrial equipment."
"They could have bought more than just 3 things. They could have gotten groceries, went to the zoo, have a nice date, gotten christmas presents, a proper jacket, whatever. They could have used that money on much better things!"
Temu has a prefab house for $14k. They make housing cheap too.
"I also worked at a bank years ago. There was one woman who was always so distraught over her negative balance, every single week, like she just didn't understand. I tried to explain to her very matter-of-factly, without judgement, that she was spending hundreds every month on fast food but she genuinely didn't see the problem. We need better financial education in our schools."
"My ex wife was constantly buying things in Amazon ""for the kids"" and then got angry that I worked 50 hours a week to afford for her to be a SAHM. I was fine with the arrangement since it made sense, but once we started the divorce process I realized how much debt she had left me with. Wild times"
How sad
People don’t know how to say no to others
"My physio-therapist told me that he is frustrated with how much his wife spends on stuff from temu. He said, at least it's for teaching, but he still feels like she didn't have to spend much before discovering temu."
"Like many addictions, this kind of shopping provides a dopamine hit that this individual is not otherwise getting in a healthier way."

Could be multiple things in one order
"If you buy literally everything you can rack up some bills, surely

Heck, I can drop $500 at the dollar store if I'm really committed"
I’ve seen ads for big items sold on Temu.
Basically anything you can get on Amazon or Aliexpress I think.
You can buy massive industrial machines on there. 
"Yeah, there is a lot more games there now. They know that people love shitty games, and they try their best to use it for sales."
Is there a real way of fighting slave owners thousands kilometers away?
I'm guessing they're working on that if they're already in their bank account
"no fucking clue, but he is on the Hoarder Spectrum."
"To be honest sometimes you can find normal stuff, same as you would buy locally - half of everything is produced in China anyway.

But that app is predatory and scummy, and you need to know pretty well what you need, what are the quality marks to look for, do your reaserch, and know what are your local options and prices."
More like the bravery to rack up this much credit card debt. I look at this and have a hunch this may exceed the person's income after necessities as well.
"Deny, delay, depose."

It's surprisingly less of a scam than Wish was. Most of the stuff comes from questionable origins though.
It's the dollar store of the internet. A lot of it is the same stuff sold more expensively by Chinese vendors on Amazon. Great selection of curtains.
"Is it a scam when people all know what is going on? Temu had been in the news so often that most adults know it is just cheap products, most of which is junk no one needs."
"That sounds like a good use of it! But I have to say I think the majority of people probably use it to buy junk that's just going to break, instead of using it to fix what they already have."
It's good for craft supplies too. Also super niche products that are into ever produced in one factory and have different brands slapped on it.
Compared to AliExpress though ?
"I totally agree, I will concede I hate that they try to gamify shopping (it doesn't work on me, it's just annoying) and try to get you to think everything on there is constantly selling out (it isn't)"
"Temu also replaced the ugly curtains in my rental. Because I bought them to fit these particular windows, I doubt they'll follow me to any future residence. But they only have to last as long as I live here, so cheap polyester is fine. 


Also, did you know that when you're an adult, you can buy curtains with massive dragons on them, put them up in your office, and no one will stop you? "
"Didn't know that kind of stuff was on there, I'll keep it in mind."
"They have everything. It’s a lot like Amazon now but more scammy looking with price fixing and games.

This is how it feeds into the addictive behaviours; it has challenges like a coupon after so many purchases and come back and sign in and grow your plants and stuff. People spend thousands to get a $60 free item. It’s a lot like gambling.

But I literally have seen the same items on Amazon for $20 that are on Temu for $7.

Same pictures and everything, same sellers."
"I'm pretty sure that all the Chinese stuff on Amazon is the same as Temu.


That said, I just moved to a new rental and Temu is nice for decorating a place that I may only live in for a few years. The curtains that came with the place were too narrow (just as wide as the window, not 1.5-2x wide to allow for clumping) and a bit drab. So I replaced them with something wider (even putting two pairs of curtains on the widest windows) and more colorful. It really elevates the room."
">talked to them about it


What's wrong with buying useful things like knitting or sewing needles? 


And if you collect dolls it rather sounds like you're in a glass house throwing stones. "
"This is the only reason that I can see people buy from there instead  of using the Respctable Elder Brother, Ali express.

You have photo reviews and customer reviews. The quality is, in 90% of what I ever got from there and I've been shopping there for more than 10 years, pretty decent. Most of the products you see on Amazon and ebay are from there, you don't need to pay another middleman and an evil corporation. Shipping is free, depending on where you live.

Would I but clothes/shoes/bags from there? Probably not unless I research it well.
Cosmetics and beauty products are off entirely, too, for safety reasons (there were nasty metals found in some, same for Temu and all Chinese cosmetics, which is whole another bag of snakes with the believeable fakes they make).
Small electronic items and house appliances are pretty decent there though.


Which is why I don't get the Temu crowd. It also carries the risk of having your info stolen."
This is why I never buy anything online ever .
"Yep. And also our dollar store culture. Buy cheap shit because even if it's useless and gets tossed in a drawer and forgotten about, or just falls apart, hey it's only $5... just keep buying more plastic shit to fill that gaping void in your life."
The fact that our PM loves gambling and refuses to remove gambling advertisements is proof this country has a gambling problem
What is the tie festival at Fed Square? I have haven’t heard but have been deeply impacted by someone who gambled everything.
"If you look at it as gambling and an addiction, it makes sense much more than just shopping. It’s the hit they get from buying, not the utility of the item. And a second hit when they open the package. 

And I know someone who had a thrift store habit kind of the same. The dopamine hit from the find was way more important than the consideration of what use the item would be. And so their entire two car garage was slowly filled with crap until they couldn’t get the cars in   That’s when others realised there was a problem."
"I know right? When I used Temu to replace the ugly or missing curtains in multiple rooms of my new rental, it came to less than $150. And that's with buying 4 panels (two pairs) of curtains for the biggest windows to achieve the ideal curtain width of 1.5-2x the window width. 


And don't worry, the ugly curtains were reused as bench covers, where they actually look kinda nice. Nothing went to waste."
Very addicting 
"Idk if you've ever used it, but the ""free items!! Spin to claim your discount!!"" thing is awful. I just wanted to buy 1 thing that a friend was begging for and I couldn't find anywhere else. It took me 25 minutes of going through ""pick 5 items"", ""now pick 4 more"", ""now pick $x of items to get these other items free"" bs before giving up and trying to find a way out so I could get to the product I clicked a link for in the first place. And then I had to go back and try to find like $7 of stuff that wasnt complete garbage to get free shipping. My mom made it all the way through that gambley section for the same friend's present and she said it took her entire 1h lunch break before she was able to actually purchase it. "
Thanks for the great explanation.
"After I purchased, I also got a dozen emails about credits for loyalty and free mystery gifts and credits for shipping delays and bonus discounts if you pick the right playing card flashing on the email screen and more credits back from your order, just spin to find out the percentage you got back. The emails are all interactive gamey gifs "
"Could you tell me more about their slave labor?  I didn’t trust them when they first came out, I did end up buying some stuff, but I don’t go there anymore."
Every $60 charge is probably 7-10 items.
"My rule for Temu is ""the fewer moving parts, the better."" 


I'm wearing a hair fork from them right now. It's a single plastic piece that came straight out of a machine, little human labor necessary. The only time one of these broke, it's because a toddler ran away with it, dropped it in the driveway, and crunch. 


But if a hair fork has any decoration, like glued on or hanging beads, I assume it will fall off from light use if not before I actually receive it. "
How do you even spend 3 grand on temu. That must’ve been like two of everything 😂
"WOW that's really something. Even if he wanted to ""blow"" some money he could've bought a whole project car. 

Or a decent PC, games, and even a target pistol.

 Or a used dirt bike and some quality tools to work on it with.

Now I'm gettin worked up over it haha"
That's more than 3 months' rent for me :(
"Even if you're content with frozen vegetables from the supermarket, $3k can buy a new couch *and* a new mattress. u/pman6 , does your relative hurt after sitting or sleeping?"
"I had $ 3066.53 - maybe I missed something, but yikes that's A LOT."
"temu literally sells everything tho. 

you can literally buy a pop up shed for $300 on there.

you can buy a sink, a deadbolt, A FAUCET??? and the best part is i’ve never actually gotten anything off there that didn’t work. but i also only shop for things i need, i just look there because it’s a lot cheaper than anywhere else."
I think I’ve seen a mini-excavator on there… but a house? I gotta check this shit out lol
"O god. I'm not surprised at all. I wonder what this person spends a year in useless garbage if this is just 1 trailer and less than 30 days, it's insane. And how many millions of people are like her"
We teach about negative numbers already. You do not need financial education to understand that 2-3 = -1 and apply it to money.
"My ex was like that... no SAHM as lesbian couple no kids, but the stupid shopping habits. We broke up and I moved up to the forest and never looked back. My current partner has zero interest in consumer crap and we live pretty much debt free and have been together 20+ years. We do maintain our own bank accounts though, with a joint one for managing household expenses"
"So what was she buying? Since you used quotation marks, it seems like it wasn't really for the kids. "
"I just wonder what caused the wound that this person is now seeking treatment for outside of themselves, rather than healing from within. It seems like a large wound that is rapidly becoming infected. Those dopamine hits are low grade pain meds that don't address the wound in any way. They will increase their dose as their tolerance grows.  While the infection will eventually become life threatening."
They sell anything and everything slaves can make.
"Is it cheaply made, or is the price just ramped up in the west?"
"But... who would buy anything this expensive with a flimsy return policy being their only guarantee?? At this point, there's seriously no reason to spend $40 more and get an item from a local franchise with a physical store. Unless the reason is they need that $40 to buy 10 more graphic tees."
Yeah they also bank on people with gambling addictions to use those apps because you technically win every time.
"""There's no ethical consumption under capitalism, so I won't try or care.""

I fucking hate this mentality, dude."
One way to fight slave owners is don't buy from Temu
"If i may ask, how did you get access to this info? The reason I ask is because I'm really hoping they turned to you for help? "
"I rent, so it's nice to spend only $20 on a pair of curtains to replace the ugly ones that came with my place. Most cheap home decor is bought by renters trying to improve a home that may only last as long as their lease. Temu and IKEA. "
"I buy most of my craft supplies from there! The only craft store we have in town is Hobby Lobby, which sells almost identical items for a 100% mark up. I’ve purchased some gorgeous fabric for sewing on Temu that $13/yard and priced at $57/yard at HL."
My boss at work got these freakin cool ass rainbow coloring pencils off Temu. All the kids love them and fight over them.
"AliExpress charges shipping for every single item unless you can find a few from the same seller, and even then only if that seller combines shipping. Which significantly affects the cost of cheap items.


Temu does free shipping with a $10 order minimum."
"They’ll last much longer than that, long after nobody wants them. But it’s good you get to feel quirky for a minute."
"That honestly is so fascinating to hear you talk about that.  I truly am so ignorant when it comes to temu, and I'm actually kind of proud of that.

I had no idea that app/company has almost in-house games to play off of addictive tendencies.  Among others.  All I can remember seeing in the ads were purses, cheap looking jackets, shoes, those types of things.  

How interesting."
"Exactly, I've found products on Amazon which are exactly the same products found on temu. The only difference is the warehouse which it's sorted and amazon isn't without fault there. Amazon Has just about as much environmental and worker exploitation problems as temu."
"Amazon went downhill a few years back once AliExpress and Temu started being a minor threat to them. They were never a moral company but they got a lot worse when they saw their empire threatened, so they decided to just do what they did."
"Lol ""elder brother."" I do buy some fabric and craft supplies from Aliexpress. I do historic costuming, and many of the fabrics and trims commonly used in the 19th C are not common now. So I'm constantly trawling for random trims, artificial flowers,  etc. I wouldn't expect quality or natural fibers except cotton, but that's where I go when I need 18 yards of close-enough lace trim on a budget! When I can't find a secondhand lot on ebay, which is how I've gotten my best bits of lace and trim. 

Side note: I cannot get rid of Aliexpress spam emails in gmail. I block and report as spam, but they just keep coming! They must use a ton of different IPs."
"Lol yeah. AliExpress is fine. It's just a regular ordering site.

Temu adds that element of fomo which is bad news."
it's an interesting way for one country to try to weaken another...
"Exactly. AliExpress is still rampant consumerism, but it’s not gamified and feels less icky. And tbh the UX is kinda bad so it means shopping isn’t “fun”. It’s just shopping."
"Good for you but you seem to be implying all e-commerce are the same which is obviously not true. Plenty of good quality brands or small business owners online as well, just don't get sucked in in the hyper fast fashion..."
"Luckely Belgium still has a lot of physical stores. I buy online, but first from local stores, delivery there and pay later option. 

I want to see the box, undamaged, unopened before I pay. I still want these stores to exist. And if I need my 2 year warranty, I want a person to help me, and not some robot AI voice. 

For everything else that I can't find, I have a list of carefully selected retailers. And never buy on some major platform that represents everything that is wrong with online sales."
Your life must suck tremendously
Bunnings has a brand of tools they stock that based on reviews and experience might last you one job if lucky.
Kmart has been one of the worst and most harmful Australian cultural phenomena we’ve experienced over the last decade. And people aren’t even embarassed to shop there for unnecessary plastic junk. I pray on its downfall.
I always have a list of what I need there.And I have bought metal baking pans that are still going strong and not rusty after two years years.The foil and baggies are great to buy those plastic casserole bowls with lids for the fridge are really good to use Mine are still going strong after one  year .You just have to know what to buy there.Those aluminum  disposable  containers are great for parties.
"But free to air TV could not exist without it, now excuse me I need to go give foxtel another government grant."
You are forgetting the mild buzz that comes from waiting for your delivery too.
"There are minority Muslim communities in China that are in internment camps and are essentially used as slave labour. If it's super cheap and comes from china, chances are there's slavery in the mix. Added to that temu mines your phone data and runs at a loss to have the most access to people's phones. Just downloading the app is enough to give all of your private conversations, location etc away. On a big scale that data can be very dangerous"
"I see, death by a thousand superficial cuts."
3k can buy an entire car
"Nah, just added again, got your value, I must've mistyped one of the numbers when I was doing the math."
It's also killing your country's economy
"interesting, i find that recently the prices aren't significantly cheaper compared to amazon and what not. Especially when buying camping gear"
they have sheds and shit
"Amazon has em, why not temu. That's where half of Amazon's stuff comes from now anyway. Sorry, Aliexpress, there's a new lower priced more addictive seller in town "
There's a lot more to financial education than understanding basic math.
"Could be shit they don't use, need, or want.

That was my mother's usual MO.
Especially with my sisters. She bought me 2 things ever, and was super careful in choosing them so no complaints, but they had so many clothes and shoes and cosmetics they flat out hate and would never use before one of them somehow convinced her to be sensible about it.
Now they just come to her with specific requests and she combs sites online looking for them. So it's not always unsolvable.


She does still buy the weirdest shit for herself though. And expensive stuff that's not practical at all. She also doesn't work or do anything."
"Outfits and clothes that were her style and not theirs. They live with me so they choose everything on their own now, since it was pointless having an entire closet of things they didn't wear or like. I think she wanted a Montessori crunchy feel for them, but they're their own people with own ideas."
"Depends on the items. You can get genuine stuff from the same factories as major brands but with a different label on it. 

You just have to be super careful about reading the listing and looking at the pictures. I've gotten some really nice stuff off there for like 10-40% of what it'd cost from a mainstream buyer in my country. 

I avoid all clothing, safety equipment and kitchen products. But for other stuff it can be good. But you've gotta be sensible about researching what you're buying."
flimsy? they’ll refund anything if you ask them to😂
Why don’t you just take the curtains with you when moving? Don’t tell me you’re the person throwing that stuff away…
"How often do you move around?? I feel like if I was moving so much, I wouldn't bother to decorate"
"Yeah I get a lot of my leather working supplies off temu. It's the exact same product without paying tons of middle men corporations. 

If you're just buying threads and needles and stuff it's way better. The key is only buying what you will actually use and having the discipline to not get suckered in by their marketing adds.

But I'm also pretty autistic and tend to hyper focus just on the craft\job I'm doing at the time so those sales tactics don't work on me cause I only have an interest in buying exactly what I want to do that job. So all the free gifts and roulette wheel shit is just easy to ignore."
"Lots of stuff from there has all kinds of nasty chemicals, I wouldn’t let kids have them."
"Not true. 

Source: I’m an AliExpress platinum user.

It depends on the seller. 

Some sellers have free shipping. 

Then there’s choice items, which have free shipping once you hit the $10 minimum."
"I live in a deeply nerdy area. Odds are good that the next tenant will also think it's cool.


ETA: The old curtains were reused as bench covers."
"> They’ll last much longer than that


Lol, not these. They're made of the same fabric as anime scroll posters. "
I think it's more that the Chinese vendors on AliExpress and Temu realized they could also make coin on Amazon.
"I think you can unsubscribe, yeah, they seem to have ramped up emailing in the last year."
Are you concerned about lead and other toxins in the fabric?
"I'm not sure if its a deliberate policy or an opportunistic one. But it works.


Tbh it's sort of poetic justice in a way, if the first one is true. The English got the Chinese addicted to Opium as a way to win a war. Now Chinese are doing it to their descendants, but with shipping. Debt isn't deadly, but it is crippling."
"If anything buying online is safer, coz you are free to compare and have time to decide, while physical stores have sales people trying to confuse you and pressure you into buying some crap."

We have so many nice stores in my town to shop at .Why would I waste my time online. I pay cash for everything  I buy and when I can't find it I don't buy it period .
"Seriously?I have bought all of my Christmas presents in real shops .I buy them and don't have to worry if they will be damaged ,lost or out of stock .I get to see them before I buy them and know I actually have them in good shape ."
"Ah, yes, the dear old ozito whipper snipper... took one look at it and noped my way out of the store."
Kmart closed down ages ago in the usa .But we do have Walmart and Target .
"Historically this was the case, but in the last five years, it's actually my go go. Reviews I read before indicate things are good quality, with some odd misses, and experience reflects this.


I have gotten a rice cooker and waffle maker that both perform at the same level as way more expensive ones.


Shelving, homewares, and even clothes are decent now - I've had tops from Cotton On that are worse quality (not that that's a high bar).


So historically I'd agree but now I think kmart is actually a good place to go for good quality items for most things, akin to middle of the range brands elsewhere."
Those factories were also used to produce PPE when COVID first came about.
It feels like speculation
This World man.  Thanks for sharing that.
"Eh. These days, I think you'd need at least $5K to buy a car that runs reliably, closer to $10K if the AC still works. $3K and you're paying more than that to fix the transmission in a month.


Unless you meant a lease. In which case, yes, $3K could be the down payment and possibly first month. 


Lots of things you could do with $3K besides a Temu habit!"
Whatever the actual amount it's crazy high. I feel better about spending a lot on eating out and events now.
as if it wasn’t a fucked system to begin with
It'll be the rejected stuff that didn't pass QC for the major brand.
"I agree, I don't think temu is markedly different from like, walmart even though this sub likes to hyperfixate on temu/shein."
I've bought some stainless screws from there before since the screws here are quite expensive while being the same quality. I checked them with a magnet to confirm that it's actually stainless and not just steel
I've gotten some cute tops. It's the same stuff that is on Amazon. I compare prices. But I don't bowith all the coupons and games. Some people think they manufacture this stuff. It's drop shipment just like Amazon.
">You just have to be super careful about reading the listing and looking at the pictures. I've gotten some really nice stuff off there for like 10-40% of what it'd cost from a mainstream buyer in my country. 

I've found some cute Anime collectables on Temu. I kid you not I found the EXACT item on Amazon for almost $90 and it was on Temu for almost half that. SAME ITEM. 

And I encourage just double checking everything. Temu does have some good stuff, just gotta dig through the crap."
"There’s more to it than getting your refund. You got the piece of crap produced and shipped halfway across the world, just to be thrown in the trash within a year."
"And if it makes you feel better, the old curtains got reused as covers for a garden swing bench. They look better there than they did on the windows."
"Because there are so many sizes of window that it's unlikely the curtains I buy for one residence will fit another. 


But why throw them away? They look nice here. I'll leave them for the next tenant. "
"Every few years. 


Also, decorating is a pleasure. If I can't afford to buy a place and remodel it to my liking, I can at least get my current home to look extra nice."
I don’t make the rules nor do I have a say in anything that gets purchased by my boss or really anything else for that matter.
"But it's a $10 minimum *from that seller.* 


Temu's $10 minimum applies to your entire cart (except for ""local warehouse"" products which are the bane of that platform). "
So why are you proud of the fact that you're buying cheap plastic crap that's going to leach microplastics and take eons to disintegrate but you will only use for two seconds?
I unsub every time and still get new ones!
Not really.  I'm buying trim to put on the outside of outfits I'll wear a handful of times.  I'm not wearing it directly next to my skin.
I find a lot of buyitforlife items are only found online.
"Your luck with finding things IRL can vary heavily depending on where you live. Charity shops in rich areas will have nice things more often than not, however those in poorer areas will have the best junk. I live in an area full of elderly people, so second-hand clothes are out of the question, as are books. eBay and Gumtree are better options but show that online shopping might be the only option at times."
"Of course, but that doesn't mean nobody can buy anything new, ever? And if they do I don't think real shops are necessarily better than e-commerce, you can find crap and quality in both."
"Australian Kmart is probably a lot like Target in the USA. But it doesn’t sell brands, everything’s home brand cheap plastic/polyester knockoffs of popular stuff (air fryers, Stanley cups, whatever’s hot/trendy on TikTok)"
"Cmon man that's some horrible logic. And sort of admitting you're cool with making it worse. 

I'm not even gonna downvote (cuz that's lame) but dude.... Cmon."
"Yeah but I'm happy buying that at 10% of the price if it means it doesn't just get put into a landfill. Which is what happens with most QC fails. 

Sometimes just a single hem being a few millimetres off or them missing out on a label on a piece of clothing is enough to just get something consigned to a landfill. 

It's impossible to consume nothing at all. You have to have clothes to go outside or you get arrested, you have to eat and drink, you have to keep your mind active with some form of media or craft.

The key is doing it responsibly and smartly and in moderation. 

OP's screenshots are not in moderation and I doubt they're responsible..

That's where overconsumption comes in. 

One of my favourite things to buy off Temu is leather working needles. They're no better or worse than the ones in my local chain craft store but it's £6 for a pack of five needles there. Whereas on temu I can get 40 needles, 4 reels of waxed thread, two thimbles and a storage case for it all for £8. 

I make costumes for a living, I do a lot of armour stuff so loads of sewing in heavy canvas, leather and tactical vest webbing. So I go through threads and needles at an alarming rate. I have to consume those products to do my job and earn my living. But why pay a ton of corporate middle men £6 for five needles when I can get a months supply for £8 and get a cool carry case I can put my other tools in afterwards.

Plus the needles from temu come in a little reusable needle tube to hold them, the ones from the craft store come stuck on a one use plastic backing in a one use plastic bag. You can't store the needles on the backing either. So temu is the better option for this.

There's no escaping capitalism for 99% of people in it as much as we'd like to. So for me it's about consuming only the minimum I need to live a fulfilled life. Taking the time to research stuff and think outside the box to find the best way of living while cutting out any non-essential consuming is the best balance most people will be able to afford. 

If Temu is the best answer for a specific item I have to have, then I will 
Use temu. If it's something else I'll use that. You've just gotta try and be disciplined about it."
"It’s funny I switched to stainless screws for my work and found they weren’t as strong or smooth as zinc. If I didn’t lube then, they’d break. Never happened with my zinc screws. For context i use them for aluminium."
"Yeah shien, ebay, amazon and Temu have a lot of the same sellers on there."
i still have all of the stuff i ordered almost 2 years ago… so idk about that.
Honestly I love temu because sometimes the cheap plasticky thing is exactly what you need and it’s super cheap. Like I needed a little drying rack for the sink. I got one on Temu for like $3 and I still use it a year later. Could have gotten a nicer one at target but it’s a dish rack. I’m trying to put it away asap lol.
I totally get it. It makes you feel a lot more at home when you decorate. At least it would for me when I lived in apartments. Versus keeping it bare and gray.
Just saying that no one really knows whats in the stuff ordered from there. Theres no regulations where they are made. Some countries in EU have made tests and they have shown harmful chemicals in the products ordered from there..
"No, “choice items” can be from different sellers."
Because it adds some cheer to a shit situation.
Consumption apologia 😂. Shame on you. I've never bought anything in my life and certainly not from one of those evil internets
I agree 100 percent.
Kmart and Target are probably interchangeable .I abhor Target .
"making it worse? lol how the fuck do you expect people to afford half the shit they sell in stores? sorry but idk about the rest of yall, but i had a whole tree fall on my house this year… and i had to pay out of pocket to fix it. i’m not paying more for *ANYTHING* than i absolutely have to."
Could get a metal one from the thrift store for $1 or 2. Just sayin.
Nothing I can do about it!l I don’t buy it.
Nothing I can do about it!l I don’t buy it.
But you're still limited to certain items that will combine shipping.
Lol.
"Well you're kinda feeding the beast this sub is against.... Its just a weird place to make your particular point. Sorry about your house, idk what to tell you."
"possibly, but it might take you a 6 months to a year of regular trips. I <3 my dishwasher so idk how rough that wait would be. I love thrifting home goods but it works a lot better for things they always have like coffee mugs, or niche things you can wait a while to find"
"Metal rusts. Especially pre used ones.

Plastic is way harder to keep sanitary due to pourousness though."
Those certain items are called “choice items”.

But does it play official Nintendo games?
Does it have Mii Maker?

[deleted]
!remindme 1 day
"its is, but they only sell 10 every day, so getting one is very unlikely because of the high number of people trying to get one aswell"
How many severs did you spam to get the switch
Doesn't it need you to do some funky sign-up raffle contest or something to buy one of those?
How were you able to order it? Anytime I tried it just instantly said I didn’t make it.
"The way it works is they do infact sell 100% real switches just only 5 I think in a 10 second period or sumthin period and cuz of that people try to get it and when they probably don't get it the buys other things 
TL;DR there real just nigh impossible to be fast enough to buy it"
I do remember seeing a video confirming it is possible to get it for free if you manage to jump through all of their hoops
"To sum up all the info about how to get this and what Temu is. At 10am EST 10 switches are sent out on the coupon section, u have to be quick cause they sell out in seconds and only appear once a day. Temu makes the ads seems like they have an unlimited amount of switches on hand and by the time most people download the app they can’t find or forget about the switch. Temu has a parent company that’s in some sketchy info stealing crap and Temu is also currently under investigation. Use at your own risk"
Glad I didn’t have 8000 pre installed games
"Crazy, I thought this was impossible cause of the bots. How fast were you to buy this?"
the thing is 100% real everyday at 10pm est they give 10 away but with the app it can access everything on you phone and can even delete the whole software that makes it work so me personally i would steer clear or the temu app for now especially while it is under review by the us government
Hey op did you know that Temu is under government investigation (they found nothing yet)
"congratulations, you’ve become a part of temu’s marketing campaign. 
normally companies pay millions of dollars for ads but all temu paid was the price of a nintendo switch."
They still selling these? :)
Do you know how often they do the flash sales? I've seen the ads many times and seriously considered checking it out (I was worried it was a scam tbh)
AINT NO FUCKIN WAY.
Was it a one time thing or...
"No joke, I'm going to buy one now just to try"
Link to buy?
Got a receipt?
This is just another advertisement for Temu I see the lies of the website
"It fucking works? That's sick, I just ordered some WH40K Legos on Temu that's all so far"
"I guess I’ll get temu my freind, I wasn’t sold until now. TAKE ME SOUL"
10PM what time zone? I'm trying to cash in on this.
"To people asking if it is real, yes it is but they only sell 10 a day"
It looks fossilized
"""lightly used"""
Tf is dat
Huh? does it work?
How much was the shipping?
It's only available on the US?
Mmm spyware 😋
Free! Free! Free! Why has no one come buy it yet?!?
The only ones scammed here are the child workers that built that thing for pennies
"I don’t trust it, op is probably a temu agent in virtual disguise"
Propaganda
I still wouldn't trust a company that's under investigation
To anyone wondering how it works from what I’ve heard they sell 10 switches per day they’re seven dollar problem is they sell out quickly
"It's real, but they only sell 10 a day, you are one lucky mf"
From what I’ve heard they only sell ten each day at 10pm EST so you got really lucky
Thze bluutootf devwice has conneted succsesfully
The temu switches are real. They sell 10 at 10:00 am everyday. There are so many people trying to grab them that they are nearly impossible to get.
Temtundo Ditch
Damn how'd you find this I downloaded the app and all I get recommend is knives and stuff lol

What did have to do to get it? I'm assuming jumping thru a lot of hoops

"They do that as well, but I think that’s for the free one. They do a flash sale for the 7$ switch. You do need to sign up, and with 24h of signing up you need to participate in the flash sale. Mine was at 10pm, might be different for you. No tricks that I saw other than it being limited to “new users” hence the 24h time limit."
"Rip, probably lost the opportunity. It’s like a 24hr after signing up time window. Then the flash sale is at a specific time, for me it was 10pm local time. I also don’t know if it happens every day or is once a week/month etc"

Where'd you buy it from
"Wow, that's unexpected"
Would like an update personally as well. Don't expect you to go out of your way for everybody but I'll leave here for myself at minimum. Please do get a switch game and if you've no intent maybe I'll send you one. Where are you located?
Good.
"Does it matter if you’ve had accounts before? Like if i remove my account and delete the app, then redownload it and create a new account will it see me as a new user? Or do I need to use a whole different device."
Wanna remember to check again tomorrow to see if you've done a video yet
How often are these flash sales? I get the ads all the time but haven't cared enough
"Oh no, I just mean when the button appears, it usually feels like it disappeared before I even got a chance to click."

bro plz can u help me get it?? im a nrw user and i cant find the ad

I jus want proof fake tech works

"Ah, nice. I'll probably forget in 20 minutes tho, don't underestimate my shit memory"
"Try and hide it but cringey ads for it all the time, shit just ain't adding up"
So first search this code on temu 192740676. This is not for the switch this code actually helps me so please do it. And for the switch. You have to actually search for it on a ad on YouTube randomly to get it for 7 dollars. But you can get it for free also with what I’m about to say. When you plug that code in it starts a game and you can choose gifts. One of those gifts can and will be a Nintendo. You then have o have people that are new and existing use your code and you can cut the price to 0 and get the items for free. If you have any other questions let me know.

Try to hide it some people don’t get a significantly discounted product but cringey adds all the time because they want people to go to their app and buy other things while looking for the $7 switch or at least that’s my thought process
"bro i search the free gifts and hat trick game but there no switch when i search up nintendo switch it dont work
also i wish i could use ur code but i alredy use my frirnd"
i rlly need the ad bro i cant find it
Me when I lie lol
tears of the kingdom?
23 in 1 console? No its a real switch.

You can use the code still. It’s for that specific game. It’s not hat trick it’s farmlands

"I've been really happy with the craft supplies I've bought (especially beads), disposable aluminum baking pans (shipped in cardboard boxes) seed starting trays with silicone bottoms,  The only things I've bought so far that were junk, was an extendable window washing squeegee (too cheaply made) and a pack of disposable aluminum trays for the air fryer (too light weight, shipped in a bag, and received crushed beyond using)."

"As an ADHD adult I did experience dopamine triggers on this platform.  Even the strategy to get the discounts can trigger simliar behavior im response to text notifications, social media paralysis and gambling -  (spin that coupon wheel! Lol). 

After 4 orders and closing my account, may this list be beneficial to you --- the good, bad and funny. 


Good values: ""Glad I gambled on the Temu version""
- Stickers, all sizes and types - amazing art & adhesive, even via washings.
- Watermelon cutter (double blade looks like a mini curved ladder) - worked like a charm on all melons, was thinking about cutting jello or ice cream, next.
- XXL women's graphic tees - I'm a size 16 and XXLs are 14, but the dark gray heather fabric from the 4 different vendors is stretchy and soft, not cheapy at all. Not silk screened, but decals are thin & seems to be adhering ok when washed. My favorite one isn't grey heather, but green heather however, the a thicker cricut material could curl in any washer setting based on past experience. No way to determine what type/iron graphic decal these are at POS.
- Organizational mini-plastic boxes - they all worked, securing my earrings & necklaces, but I didn't need 50 of them.
- Canvas (pvc?) prints - *ADHD buy. For a buck, worth the gamble. I selected 8, and only 2 never made it to my walls - bad color process & cut at angle. These arrive as standard size prints (bleeds to edge) on plasticky canvas rolled up! There is no extra margin or white border.  After placing the 6 under heavy books for 1 day, I spray adhered them to cardboard, and framed with a thin mat. Suggest sizing up for frame. Even better, look for frames at garage sales or go to online Gifting/No Purchase neighborhood FB groups.
- Notebooks all sizes - 100% worth it. 
- Massager - paid $15 USD after coupons - almost deleted it from cart, because this was more than i wanted to gamble. Shipped perfectly, it works...certified via UK and works well for acupuncture trigger points. It's not the $80 Costco version, but that's OK. 
- Clear plastic cross body bag - perfect size; broad strap elongates. Betting this $3 USD investment will last longer than my $15 Amazon version. No wear or tear yet.
- Black sweater with white leopards on arms XXL - Loved it. Looked just like the pictures. Nifty novelty item. No cruddy tag to cut out, too. Too bad I couldn't fit my head in it. XXL= size 14 in Temu women's clothing. Yet comparing it to my US size 12 sweaters, it's a size 12 if you like your acrylic sweaters a little roomy (not loose, just not skin tight). My XXL Temu tshirts are bigger than this XXL sweater. Still loved the execution of the design, had to ship it back. I'll look for plus size version.

Total misses: ""What was I thinking?""
1. Polyester graphic dress blouses - pretty in pics, but cheap graphic printing on top of cheaper poly fabric with an the obvious back seam (scratchy) & tiny, rolled hems is just one wash or stretch away from unraveling or tearing. IMHO, skip these. Better made & priced clothing can be found at Wal-Mart, TJMaxx, Target or Goodwill/ Resale. 

2. Brow markers - if you're Groucho Marx and prefer long wearing formula, this is for you.  Impossible to apply light, hair strokes to my brows & practicing any technique with this three prong marker on the back of my hand proved it just bleeds. Just go to any drug store for better proven application & formulas. Might make this one a kids marker, or Halloween makeup. 

3. Pen exacto knives - Imagine using a dry fountain pen as it scrapes and scratches thru your paper. Just buy the real exacto knives.

"Women's pajamas are surprisingly nice.  Household cleaning tools are good (sponges, brushes, dish scrapers). Got some fake ivy for a false privacy area and it's good.  I don't think I would buy anything consumable or to put on the skin though.  Or electronics."
"I’ve found good luck with ergonomic office supplies. I got wrist rests for both the keyboard and mouse that are nicer than ones I bought on Amazon. Also got compression braces for my arms, elbow, and wrist. All very good quality and a fraction of the price if I ordered locally. 

I also bought one of those covered makeup organizers    that retails here for $60. Paid $25. It holds so many products and makes my life much easier."
"I’ve gotten many good clothing items, mostly athletic wear. My wife loves the swimwear. So cheap items under $10. They have survived multiple washings. Why pay $50-$100 from lululemon, etc. it’s all made in china. (what isn’t). I avoid electronics. Anything that should last a long time like good leather shoes is probably a no. I did buy a men’s leather clutch and so far so good (been almost a year) it’s perfect. What more can I say?"
Their prices are seldom low anymore as they were a year ago.  They compare closely to Amazon now.
"I agree that Temu’s crafting stuff is great. They have amazing prices on diamond art kits. It’s a little hit or miss how good the design turns out though. But I’ve done some amazing ones. Lots of great PET stickers too. I have trouble finding ones with the clear background elsewhere. 

I’ve liked their shirts—some gorgeous designs. And their nail decorations like stickers, wraps, and press ons. 

The kitchen supplies I’ve gotten were pretty cheap and disappointing. They always are great with returns though."
"Sucess:
-Stick on tattoos (I bought many different kinds for the school's fun fair and all worked well and were much cheaper than amazon)
-Croc charms - still on the shoes after a year of wear
-card games - really liked quibbler and five crowns - about 25% cheaper than Amazon
- card pack plastic holders 
- hamster cage accessories and hamster houses, much better quality than I expected 
- fake plastic eyes for crochet projects (sometimes the little plastic backings were crap but there are 200 of them in a pack for wayyyyy cheaper than at Micheal's 
- crochet needle case
-tambourine for karaoke fun times - it's amazing way better than what I expected
- sun catcher crystal prism things - awesome
- loot bags stuff - bookmarks, funny pencils, erasers, snap bracelets
-barf bags (yeah this is a thing lol) my kiddo suffers from terrible motion sickness and we always have to annoy the flight attendants for so many plastic bags, these things were compact and had a cardboard/harder plastic at the top to hold onto and pack up very small. 

Very unsuccessful 

- wall art posters - weird pvc vinyl and came creased 
- skirts 
- bike lights
-cat house - cardboard / crappy wood looked awful
- cat house - soft fabric, had zero structure and flimsy
-guitar/ukulele cord charts- came on weird pvc vinyl with sticky backing and could not get the wrinkles out
- eye makeup - crap"
"I would never buy anything electrical  as unless it is UL or ETL certified, I will nat chance it.  Craft items are fabulous and decorative items for the home are very reasonable.  The clothing is all poly for the most part."
"Hits:

- Cricut supplies

- Soap pumps

- Dog squeaky toys

- Stair tread rugs

- Plant stuff

- Silicone molds

  
Misses:

- Towel bars, I tried 3 of them and they were all horrible. They were all crooked and had scratches/dents

- Paint rollers

- Tape refills for Dymo label makers. Stick with the branded ones."
"I've placed several orders over the year. 
Some good things:
a nimbot label maker. 
A soundbar which I use with a usb for music. 
A set of 5 black yoga pants for work, very comfy and wash well. Underwear. 
Jumpers are good for the price. Tape to block a draft at the bottom of the door but extra double sided tape is needed. 
Ear rings, although a few were no good. 
A toilet seat cover, it's foamy and warm lol. 
Some bad things were hooks, always fell off. 
Some shelves, didn't stay up. 
I could probably mention more."
"Backpacks are pretty decent quality, got a portable power bank that works really good. Another backpack lol solar panels for hiking actually work pretty good will charge the power bank or my phone. Flat bill hats, not the greatest material/quality but look and fit goof for 3 bucks. RGB mousepad for 6 bucks works and feels good."
Watercolor paper Baohong cold press- surprisingly good.
Welding gloves are impressively good
"I wouldn't purchase anything that connects to your phone/computer with bluetooth or over wifi, they will almost always include software that farms data. But I do buy electronic components off Temu for DIY projects, like sensors, boards. I also buy craft supplies off there, mica powders are good, dried flowers or miniature crafts for resin art are good as well."
Knock boxes for coffee.
"I’d say anything that isn’t trying to be a dupe and that you can’t find on Amazon. Things that don’t cost a lot of money because they are not high value items. For example. Cute phone cases with different designs that are cheap. A water proof wall mounted phone cover so you can watch a show or listen to music while you shower. Inexpensive things that you don’t need to be expensive but has some good household use is always nice. 

A collapsible laundry basket
Space saving items
Cute cheap sponges for dish washing that are cheaper than what you’d find on Amazon.
Organization items.
Crocs dupe

Mainly anything you would intentionally not mind if it’s cheap because it’s more for utility than aesthetic and it will not be noticeable. example: a bathroom trash bin, cleaning towels, cleaning products, salt and pepper shaker.

Also sometimes I go on Temu because I find what I’m looking for faster on there or something I’d never thought about and then I’ll just look for that thing on Amazon too."
I have got some nice PJ’s and women’s tee shirts and blouses. The jeans are good. A couple of cute purses. Some nice canvas wall art. Women’s leggings and some cute phone cases.
Mouse pads.  The selection of prints and sizes is enormous and ridiculously cheap.
"Tarot deck knock offs are nice. 
Other than that cleaning supplies but not any compound as that can be risky. 
Small factor electronics such as earbuds, USB cables, chargers, adapters etc. 
You can also buy tiny magnets or bearings for projects. Maybe screws of some exotic variant too.
Bags, wallets and cases.
Tiny quality of life items too, such as pill sorters got the elderly, 
You can buy dumb little toys such as luminescent laces, bubble machine, colored DnD dice, printed card and board games etc."
Shirts I find worth it. Swimsuits and shoes not worth it. Shelves good. Kitchen utensils are ok.
"Custom press on nails. Not the 24 pls but the 10 pls that make you choose a size. 
Moissanite rings 
Baby clothes

On clothes just don’t try to go for polyester, viscose and bamboo are great, and cotton.

I also got a 500 in one handheld game console that has kinda bad battery life but the games are actually awesome, just get a external battery pack backup."

"phone cases, especially if you like to switch them up a lot."
I’ve purchased several things from Temu recently and am super surprised at the overall quality of almost every item. Shoes were a miss (flip flops had zero grip on the bottom) but that’s been my only disappointment so far. They truly have some great deals!

This is pretty self explanatory. For whatever reason code exchanging can get heated. It should not. Sometimes mods have to step it. Keep it civil between each other. And definitely if a mod is helping or looking in.
You mean like T•fal who poisons us with pfas? I don’t trust the U.S. government to protect us from Jack. Not that I’m saying I trust Temu either.
They are getting closer to Amazon. But that's always been their business model is sometimes their stuff cost more but it's listed more than once and you can find it at a cheaper price for the same exact product even from the same company. The service is actually excellent though they've always taken care of me I really like temu.
"Ive gotten some good deals on temu when I work in their 30% deals... they add tax for me which is 10%. Mostly I use others. They have always included a box or factory bag, but often it has temu tape all over it.

Yes, you definitely have to take care on their misleading pricing."
$35 for 128 pieces is crazy
"To me, Temu is kind of like Amazon.  It is not unusual to find the same product at multiple price points.  It is usually worth the effort to try multiple searches with different keywords to make sure you find the best deal."
"Temu stopped selling the minifigures, it was one the few things on the app I liked."
"Personally, the worst thing about Temu (and AliExpress) is when they list something with a photo and it's actually for the motorized part.  So many times I've clicked on a listing and then realized it's a bait and switch.  Pretty much now I only use Temu and AliExpress for when I'm waiting on a Marstoy order and am jonesing for something to build in the interim."
You should not use temp period

Fuck both of these sites
"well this is a dumb statement.. If i feel anything is too high priced for my liking, i'll do my research, and browse other platforms."
Good luck getting your credit card information stolen!
"I’ve gotten some great deals on Temu without any coupons or added discounts… mainly the Leji UCS Slave I for $65 and Jiestar UCS TIE Bomber for $20. The LionKing (I think) 75105 Millennium Falcon I got was only $30, but it had a few missing pieces and absolutely bizarre design alterations.

So far I’ve had a better hit rate on Temu than AliExpress, but that’s mostly just the fault of Bela unloading partially defective Scooby Doo sets (damaged/warped pieces, sticker and minifig printing way off) into the market."
That's Lego pricing :)
Yeah I remember seeing the photos of ppl posting it. We had similar purges on AE too though.
No the worst thing about Temu is when they steal your credit card information
But then another $5.39 and a month and a half wait for shipping.
Count yourself lucky.
Good
Nah Ali Express is a lifestyle
"no, kindly unfuck them"
Then what are you doing here? Tons of people here order their lego minifigs and cloned sets from Ali or Temu.
"I don't think the source of the recent Scooby Doo flood is actually BELA. They shut down 4 years ago, and the stuff we see now is one step below in quality. If we look at old blog posts and old YouTube videos, the BELA stuff ruled. 

But comparing it to what's available now, we can see the quality decline: wrong hairpieces, wrong torso and arm printing, wonky colors on printed legs, thick and low-res raised printing on minifigures, stickers of the wrong color...

Scooby stuff was HTF for a long time and recently, the Mummy museum, plane and lighthouse suddenly became available. This all feels like a second-string manufacturer starting up a new production line.

Beggars can't be choosers, so we pay cheap prices to get iffy quality Scooby. It's how the current game is played."

20$ for the ucs tie bomber? Do you have a link for me?
Even for lego is way too high
"Funny how you get downvoted for it. Temu is a data mining company after all considering the company behind Temu. The concerns about Temu are valid.
If ppl are fine with it, that’s okay too ofc. 

I for one won’t use it (I was thinking about it before I looked it up)."
"TIL.

I got a reasonable Haunted Mansion clone set with passable minifigs, but the Mystery Machine set was godawful.

In that set, Fred and Shaggy both have erroneous printing on their faces that make them look zombie-ish, Shaggy’s hair is wrong and his pants are a noticeably different tint, the van’s roof plates warp enough to make it hard to have it sit flush, the rails/roof rack look like someone cut it to length with toddler safety scissors before it set from molding. And lastly, the sticker sheet had a color scheme of red, forest green, and Kelly green instead of orange, lime green, and light blue."
"Yeah, I have my suspicions on that too. I have several older BELA sets and no regrets, but after reading these reviews mentioning the ""new"" BELA,, I am definitely easing back on the clone sets under that brand."
No. It was three months ago on Temu. The listing’s been gone for nearly the same amount of time.
"The new stuff has the ONLY advantage of being available and cheap. I can live with it. The alternative is expensive prices for real-L, or waiting for Creepy Hybrid to find one and paying quite a bit for shipping from Malaysia to the US.

I'm waiting for that Webrick 3rd Anniversary sale. I have 2 LEGO skeleton heads that want bodies to add to the Evil Pharaoh's Army. A few months back, I got a really good Pharaoh Mummy fig from Marstoy, and if they reclaim their Mummy Museum Mystery sarcophagus and partial temple, they can march through the Stargate for a mummy and skeleton invasion!"
"Yeah, I'm waiting to see if LolToy manages to get any of the older Monkie Kid sets (mainly Pigsy's Noodle Tank) before I dabble with any of the new BELA sets. In the meantime, I got other sets to line my shelf with."

I would kill them with fire. Leave the ashes in the stove and burn them again and again until spring when I clean out the stove. Even if they do not burn, the high heat will kill them.
If you do not have a woidstove, cutting torch or gasoline in a can, then light it. Repeat until they are ash.
If you are not as violent and destructive as ne and do not have a woodstove, cutting torch or a place to burn a can of gasoline, see if your local government  has a department to asvise farmers or maintains forests. I do not know where you live, but here in CT, USA, the state has such a department.  Mostly, they advise farmers on how to combat insects or diseases attacking their  crops by examining samples and identifying the plant or insect. But anybody can use the service. I am certain that if I brought them these seeds, they would be able to identify the plant and advise on how to destroy them. I assume if they are invasive or illegal or even if I just said I got them from Temu, they would confiscate them and destroy them for me."

"I know that the last time random seeds were showing up in the mail, people were quick to explain it away as a ""positive review scam,"" and it might be.

But, is it so unbelievable that a foreign power would prey on our ignorance, hoping people will unwittingly plant the invasive seeds they receive? Last time, lots of people planted those seeds without thinking, and we still don't have a full accounting of the environmental jeopardy that caused.

Anecdotally, where I live in NH, I have noticed a significant rise in invasive species over the last few years. 2 species in particular stand out: Oriental Bittersweet, and Japanese Knotweed. The bittersweet is the worst, vines that race up and throttle the trees they climb, bringing them down fairly quickly if left unchecked. I see both of these in abundance, in people's yards and along the roads, and they were not there 4 years ago.

If you wanted to do some damage to a rival nation, but you didn't want to act overly aggressive and risk a larger conflict, this is the kind of thing you do. Especially considering how inexpensive and easy the operation would be to execute."

it looks like wildflower seeds
Brushing scam.
You don't want to plant things that you don't know what they are. I've heard China does this to introduce non native species that will f&*$ our ecosystem up or are poisonous etc. I would Google it. Kind of like a warfare tactic
Throw them in a pot and see what happens

Invasive plants do not plant them
And that's how Covid got to the US.

Prbly invasive lol
These are invasive species seeds I’ve heard of this before.  One person puts them in a pot outside and then seeds scatter destroying our natural landscape.  Report it anytime you get “something free” there is a catch

Do not plant mystery seeds. They could be extremely invasive and cause a lot of problems.
DO NOT PLANT THAT. It could destroy all kinds of crops and plants through pollination or out-competition.
DO NOT PLANT THIS COULD DESTORY OUR ECOSYSTEMS . PLEASE REPORT THEM TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT
That is the story of my sperm. Always ends up in a tissue in the garbage though.

I would not buy from Temu seeds. First they don't send what u order but u can sprout them and it might be invasive plant  being that were in a soft war with them soon to be full on - their assertions- u might wanna stop doing it.  Buy American   Please   Many on Etsy and big seed companies to buy from.
I was gonna say weed till I seen the 2nd photo
Has to be magic beans
TIL why I keep receiving boxes of weird/sometimes cool stickers from Temu. I have thousands of them. Ordered 1 set of ceramic knives from them 2 years ago and get 2-3 packages of stickers a month ever since.
I thought I saw something about this on the news. Don't plant them they are an invasive species.
Poppy seeds! Plant them and start your own opium farm!
My dumbshit boomer father in law would try to grow these. Here comes an even more resilient kudzu to take over.
Honestly the best way to dispose of those seeds safely is to eat them

Weed?
Probably some invasive crap from China. Toss it.

I wouldn't plant them. Invasives risks are sketch. We already have enough invasive plants
Everyone saying don’t plant them has more willpower than I. I’d stick it in an indoor pot just so I could identify it 😅
DO N9T PLANT THOSE!!!!  This could be hyper invasive species of plants and can harm the natural ecosystems!

Get a flower pot and plant them in it. Wait until they grow. Upon the first harvest moon sacrifice what has grown to the goddess Demeter. After waking the following morning you will possess a green thumb. It’s very similar to going to a crossroads at midnight and learning how to play the guitar from the devil. I’ve done both and now I make my own guitars from trees I’ve planted.

It might be wrong but I also heard these seeds are usually invasive species.
I wouldnt be surprised if the ccp was sending invasive species thru temu like this.
"Do not plant them.

Do I believe this is intentional biological warfare spread by hateful, mustache-twirling evil boogeyman masterminds waging a covert war against us? No.

To everyone who thinks they're intentionally destroying our crops: take a wild guess who China buys 30% of their soybeans from. 

It's some ""mail you a useless product"" then have bots create fake bullshit reviews on their page scam, perpetrated by people living in dense cities with very little understanding of ecology... in a country where environmental laws are seen as guidelines at best.

That said... eurasian milfoil, japanese knotweed, and kudzu are fast growing, lack natural predators in our ecosystems, and have become invasive nuisances that outcompete our native plants.

You should report this to the USDA and have those seeds destroyed."
bag of invasive species . ccp plan crush soak i bleach and discard
This is how invasive species get spread
I don't think that's even legal
my buddy told me the chinese send random people invasive species seeds hoping a few will plant them and they'll slowly take over. says the CCP is playing the long game... i saw this post and now don't think he's crazy
Be careful some seeds are poisonous and unless you know and are knowledgeable I wouldn’t be opening random seeds from another country.
"To me, it looks like a bunch of spices for garam masala. I use some garam masala spice when I'm cooking and some of these seeds look exactly like them. Like cumin seeds and fenugreek seeds. I might be wrong tho."

I did think it was a bit odd tbh
Brushing I think…
"I've always been confused with this scam. Why do they add the packet of seeds? All that seems to do is draw attention, and add the chance of them potentially getting into a lot of trouble for sending in foreign plant matter. Why not just send an empty package, a bit of cardboard, whatever? 

Always wonder this with these ones - I've received seeds myself in the past."
I've seen people get cheap toys and stuff like phone cases and workout accessories shipped like this before. Seeds are unfortunately the worst I've seen haha
I got a watch.
"I think what you're describing is called ""Brushing""."
"Is it though? OP, check your order history. Have you ordered seeds at all in the past?

Any idea what plant they are from?
Thanks for that well informed note. How do you recommend OP dispose of them?
I see these posts all the time. What are the risks of planting them? And I'm sure there's someone who cultivates mysterious seeds from (presumably) Asia.  Know if there's a website or channel about it?
"Oh good idea. I recommended boiling them, but that works quicker."
Heat will not kill all seed types. Soak them in 25% drain cleaner and 75% water solution.
"Are you people serious, Just burn them?? I mean, drain cleaner? Really?"
Why?
"Thank you, I had never heard of these before. Also seen planting them is stupid as could be an invasive species. ( but it does intrigue me). Mrs already put em in the bin"

"That was my thought, report them but to which agency? Local authorities likely wouldn’t give a damn and would say to just toss them but I would think the US Dept of Agriculture would care to hear about it. They’ve probably gotten lots of reports like this by now."
"people are dumb as fuck, thats why."
"Some seeds require fire for germination, so trying to incinerate might not destroy them."
I hope this was a Little Shop Of Horrors reference 🤣 because bravo! 👏🏻
Not sure about this particular package of seeds but they may be invasive plants or genetically modified in some way which could displace local native plants.
Don’t plant that trash either
I guess it has something to do with the actual restrictions on seeds. Every internationally mailed package of seeds has to have a lot number on it and indeed OP's seems to. Maybe this also serves as a defacto tracking system for the shills and adds additional level of proof for the fake authenticity.
"My guess is that they are light weight so the shipping is cheaper, and maybe something to do with matching the value of the actual product being reviewed, like they can change it to whatever they want based on the amount of seeds but idk if that makes a difference. Also why not just commit bioterrorism while you’re at it."

I think not knowing is a big reason not to plant them. Plus I doubt they can be told by sight so easily.
"They are a form of eco terrorism. Invasive species being sent for free to people around the west, hoping that gullible people will plant them and ruin our ecosystem."

"Introducing a new species from somewhere else can be really hard on an ecosystem. That's where invasives can come from. Ecosystems take 10s off thousands of years to find balance. This can be undone by air mail. 

Different places also have different diseases. They might not even be a problem where they're from, but a new place might not be resistant to that fungus or bug or bacteria or virus. 

You're not really even supposed to bring outside camp fire wood into a forest from another forest locally due to concerns. Certainly shouldn't just be tossing unknown alien life around"
"I’ve seen boiled seeds germinate. It was unintentional, but they survived."
"Microwaves don’t kill by heat, they kill by the microwaves heating up the water in the seeds. This kills the seed and prevents germination. Microwaves are also how they kill off microbes in imported food as well. Well microwaves and X-rays."
"A short boil might not do it, but heat will kill all seed types.  If it doesn't, you didn't apply enough heat."
"Yeah, I don't know how ""burn them"" isn't the easiest thing to do here. I guess not everybody regularly has fires tho lol"
"The odds they are invasive is too high. Plus they can easily harbor disease that will attack food crops.

Sending random seeds that don't get cleared is really just eco terrorism with a flimsy excuse."
Non native plants that will harm native plants and animals.
"Ecological Terrorism, that's why."
for example black currant was banned till 2017 or 2019 or so from the us because the plants carry a disease killing white pines

Good to know! Thanks!
Dude ive seen improperly autoclaved milo and oats sprout. High heat and 15psi for like an hour instead if the standard 90-120 minutes. I couldn't belive they could live through that
Microwaves don't kill by heat. They kill by heat! LOL!
Some seeds require fire to germinate. Some seeds require freezing to germinate. Crushing or microwaving is the best bet here.
wait until you find out that forests regrow after forest fires.
"Some species have fire-activated seeds. Their seeds are completely encapsulated in resin, and require fire to crack open the casing to let water and oxygen inside. Giant Sequoia being one of them."
"Eucalyptus, manzanita, ponderosa pine, Ceanothus (California Lilac, North America), Themeda triandra (Kangaroo Grass, Africa/Australia), Phacelia spp. (Scorpionweed) are some examples of pyrophytes that require fire or intense heat to germinate. It's a good strategy. The fire clears all the competition, and then they sprout. Gives them a good headstart. 

I've autoclaved oats an milo for a shorter amount of time than required and they still sprouted. 15psi and very high heat for 60 minutes still didn't kill them"
"Honestly people forget that the West and China are essentially at war.

Not a guns and bombs war, but an economic and an ecological one.

A lot of Western ideas and laws don't align with the Chinese, and some of it's citizens, as well as ours, harbor hate for one another. And this is exactly an easy outlet to send that hate how you described."
"I used to hunt morel mushrooms in a wooded area just outside of town. Found lots of morels every year amongst the native multiflora rose, Jack in the pulpit, and may apples. Someone thought it a good idea to put mountain bike trails through the trees. Now the whole area is covered in a type of mustard and it is so aggressive that none of the native plants can grow and the mushrooms are gone. It's believed that the mustard came in as hitchhiking seeds on the bikes and clothing of the mountain bikers. The whole area is ruined and there's really no way to eliminate the mustard."
Shits delicious tho
Please don't plant them.  They could be an invasive species and hurt local plants.

"come on, it's not the seeds fault they were part of a scam :(

edit: ok nvm maybe the risk of plant disease and invasives isnt worth it..."
don't throw them in the trash as they can still grown once they get to the landfill.  if you have the means burn them
"Yes, came to say this, there is a theory that foreign actors are trying to introduce noxious weeds that could affect agricultural business! Edit fungi and bacteria are also transported in seeds!"
"No, and I'm afraid it's now spreading Chinese propaganda throughout the neighborhood."
"Agreed that the round black ones are some sort of brassica. These packages also often include hibiscus, rose seeds, and sage seeds, and that does seem to line up with some in this one. 

Not a guarantee though, not worth risking. And keep in mind, these aren't necessarily going to turn out to be some gorgeous variety of flower you find in a garden center. We don't tend to reproduce things like roses via seed either. Cloning and grafting are pretty common amongst certain types of plants/trees that we grow these days(roses, fruit trees, etc)

What about blending? Any downsides?
“for like an hour instead of the standard 90-120 minutes” so 60 min instead of 90-120 is more harsh?
To be fair they did survive a meteor impact probably due to the hardiness of their seeds
"The difference is that microwaves boil an the water inside an object from inside out and passes through solids. Heat burns the outside in, but must damage a surface of a solid and cannot pass through."
"It’s actualy a big difference, it’s not simply heating the object, it vibrates the water molecules in the object and that vibration is what heats the object. Microwaves also shred DNA."
What about the seeds that require drain cleaner to germinate?
They can still be destroyed by fire.
All of those seeds can also be destroyed by fire. They are not fire proof.
A gaggle of goats will eat that stuff right up.
I won’t mate im just finding out how I should get rid of them as the rubbish seems to be a Nono. Sealed packet should be ok tho shouldn’t it ?

Wtf tell me more!!!! So like no earthworm type is original to north American and what do worms have against big forests that would stop them from getting so big.  Where is a worm guy when I need one!
"From your link:

>**Almost** every earthworm in most of the U.S. came from somewhere else. Native earthworms **all but disappeared** more than 10,000 years ago, when glaciers from a Pleistocene ice age wiped them out. A few survived further south. But today, virtually all earthworms **north of Pennsylvania** are non-native.

>1600s

Damn, you kinda butchered that."
Seriously??? I have always had a phobia about earthworms! Now I want to go back in time and hurt whoever brought them here.
I meann you're not wrong
"I don't know about tumbleweaves, but tumbleweed was introduced in 1873. It was probably a contaminate seed in flax seed from Russia's Ural Mountains."
This immediately made me think of somebody’s old extensions rolling through the streets 😂
Just like moose are native to New Zealand
"Yes. It's Russian thistle.

So helpful and informative thanks!!
"If your bush does as much damage as giant hogweed, you should be in an institution. You could kill someone by scratching your balls and touching someone without washing your hands."
How?
It’s high noon
Reach for the sky
1v1 me High Noon bro
"Idk man the last confrontation I remember hearing about as a kid between a cowboy and a China man ended up with peepee in coke, I'm not to confident in the cowboy coming out on top this time either."
Did you know it's still law that it is illegal to challenge someone to a duel
"No point, the Temu Representative's gun will fall apart the second they draw."
Looks like we got ourselves a good ol’ Mexican standoff
We ride at DAWN!!!
Made my fucking day
Oh so fuck the Russians. I should have guessed.
"Here's an article talking about it: [https://ecosystemsontheedge.org/earthworm-invaders/](https://ecosystemsontheedge.org/earthworm-invaders/)

TL:DR : earthworms bring nutrients deep in the soil to the surface, promoting growth of plants with shallow roots but penalizing trees, which have deep roots to get the nutrients deeper in the soil."
"This info applies to the Northeastern US - but the northwestern US does have some remaining native earthworms, and the southwestern US has even more.

We even have one particularly large native species here in Oregon: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon\_giant\_earthworm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_giant_earthworm)

ETA - the glaciation that killed most of the US and Canadian ones covered the eastern states far more than western, and some of the native species still live on here on the west and southwestern parts of the us."
"What happened is that I had some neat trivia in mind, went to google to get imperfect information from articles' headlines then when pressed for more info read an article in particular which contradicted some of the points I had first provided. 

Thank you for the correction."
Blame fishermen. They were the ones who brought them to the New World as bait for fish.
I heard that they were intentionally planted by ranchers to serve as cattle feed but then the cows never ate them.
"Giant hogweed makes your skin photo sensitive, even by brushing up against it. You end up with a nasty blistering sunburn wherever you got it on your skin. Awful stuff! I have no idea what hogweed seeds look like, BTW."
